This energy comes from the food you eat, so you may feel a need for food after exercising. As your body works harder, it generates heat, which causes you to sweat. Sweating helps regulate your body temperature and prevent overheating. Additionally, when you exercise, you put stress on your muscles, which causes tiny tears in the muscle fibers. As your body repairs these tears, your muscles grow stronger and more defined. This process is called muscle hypertrophy, and it is what allows you to build muscle mass. Over time, regular exercise can also improve your overall fitness level, making it easier to perform physical tasks and activities.
