Race track - While there may be people at a race track, it is not necessarily a place where a lot of people gather. B. Populated areas - This is a good option as populated areas are places where a lot of people live and gather. C. The desert - This is not a good option as the desert is typically a remote and uninhabited area. D. Apartment - This could be a good option as apartments are often located in populated areas where there are a lot of people. E.
