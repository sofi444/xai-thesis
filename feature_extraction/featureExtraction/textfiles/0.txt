The sanctions were a punishing blow, which means they were severe and had a negative impact on the school. The word "seemed" suggests that the efforts the school had made to change were not recognized or appreciated. Therefore, we can eliminate options A, D, and E, as they do not fit the context. Option C, authoritarian, does not make sense either, as it does not relate to the idea of sanctions or efforts to change. The correct answer is B, enforce, as it implies that the sanctions were implemented and had an impact on the school's efforts to improve.
