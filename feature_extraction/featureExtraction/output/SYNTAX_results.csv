0	"The sanctions were a punishing blow, which means they were severe and had a negative impact on the school. The word ""seemed"" suggests that the efforts the school had made to change were not recognized or appreciated. Therefore, we can eliminate options A, D, and E, as they do not fit the context. Option C, authoritarian, does not make sense either, as it does not relate to the idea of sanctions or efforts to change. The correct answer is B, enforce, as it implies that the sanctions were implemented and had an impact on the school's efforts to improve."	0.10256410256410256	0.0	0.008547008547008548	0.042735042735042736	0.10256410256410256	0.017094017094017096	0.017094017094017096	0.1794871794871795	0.05982905982905983	0.0	0.1282051282051282	0.042735042735042736	0.1452991452991453	0.0	0.0	117
1	Sammy wants to go where the people are. This means he is looking for a place where there are a lot of people. A. Race track - While there may be people at a race track, it is not necessarily a place where a lot of people gather. B. Populated areas - This is a good option as populated areas are places where a lot of people live and gather. C. The desert - This is not a good option as the desert is typically a remote and uninhabited area. D. Apartment - This could be a good option as apartments are often located in populated areas where there are a lot of people. E.

4	The fox walked from the city into the forest, which suggests that it was looking for a change of environment or habitat. Therefore, the most likely answer is C. natural habitat. The other options, such as pretty flowers or a storybook, are unlikely to be the fox's motivation for leaving the city and entering the forest. The option of a hen house is possible, but it is not the most likely answer as the fox could have found food in the city as well. The option of a dense forest is also possible, but it does not provide a clear reason for the fox's movement from the city.	0.024793388429752067	0.0	0.0	0.024793388429752067	0.08264462809917356	0.008264462809917356	0.049586776859504134	0.21487603305785125	0.09917355371900827	0.0	0.05785123966942149	0.09090909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.024793388429752067	121

6	The woman checked a drawstring bag as her only baggage. This suggests that she was traveling somewhere, as she wouldn't need to check a bag if she was just going about her daily routine. Option A, garbage can, doesn't make sense as it's unlikely that someone would check a bag in a garbage can. Option B, military, is a possibility, but it's not clear why the woman would be checking a drawstring bag for military purposes. Option C, jewelry store, also doesn't make sense as it's unlikely that someone would check a bag at a jewelry store. Option D, safe, is a possibility, but it's not clear why the woman would be checking a drawstring bag in a safe. Option E, airport, seems like the most likely answer. If the woman was traveling by plane, she would need to check her bag before boarding.

7	The forgotten leftovers had gotten quite old, which means they were left uneaten for a long time. The next clue is that they were covered in mold, which suggests that they were exposed to moisture. Finally, the question asks where the person found the leftovers. Based on these clues, the most likely answer is B. refrigerator. Leftovers are typically stored in the refrigerator, and if they are forgotten and left there for too long, they can become moldy. The other options (carpet, breadbox, coach) are less likely because they are not typical places to store food.	0.125	0.0	0.0	0.05357142857142857	0.09821428571428571	0.044642857142857144	0.07142857142857142	0.16071428571428573	0.044642857142857144	0.0	0.14285714285714285	0.08035714285714286	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.008928571428571428	112

9	A business restaurant is likely to be located in a place where there are many businesses and offices. This means that option D, business sector, is the most likely answer. However, it is also possible for a business restaurant to be located in a hotel (option B) or a mall (option C) if there are many businesses and offices in the surrounding area. Option A, town, and option E, yellow pages, are not specific enough and do not necessarily indicate a high concentration of businesses and offices.	0.0196078431372549	0.0	0.0	0.029411764705882353	0.08823529411764706	0.0196078431372549	0.049019607843137254	0.28431372549019607	0.049019607843137254	0.0	0.049019607843137254	0.0784313725490196	0.14705882352941177	0.0	0.0	102
10	The question states that the wife was doing all the work before getting a divorce. This implies that she was likely feeling overwhelmed and burdened by the workload. Therefore, option A, harder, could be a possible answer. However, the question specifically asks about her feelings before getting a divorce, so we need to consider emotional states as well. Given the context of the situation, it's possible that the wife was feeling resentful or bitter towards her husband for not contributing equally to the household chores. Therefore, option C, bitterness, could also be a possible answer. Option B, anguish, and option E, sadness, could also be possible answers as the wife may have been feeling emotionally drained and exhausted from the workload. Option D, tears, is a physical manifestation of emotions and may not necessarily be the primary feeling the wife was experiencing.Overall, the most likely answers are A, harder, and C, bitterness.	0.04395604395604396	0.0	0.005494505494505495	0.027472527472527472	0.0989010989010989	0.016483516483516484	0.08241758241758242	0.2087912087912088	0.06043956043956044	0.0	0.08791208791208792	0.07692307692307693	0.15384615384615385	0.0	0.0	182

13	The question states that of all the rooms in a house, this particular room is the person's favorite. This means that the person enjoys spending time in this room. The question also mentions that the aromas always draw the person to this room. This means that there are usually pleasant smells coming from this room. Option A, yard, is unlikely to be the correct answer because the question specifically mentions a room in the house, and a yard is not a room. Option B, basement, is also unlikely to be the correct answer because basements are often associated with dampness and musty smells, which are not usually pleasant aromas. Option C, kitchen, is the most likely answer because kitchens are often associated with cooking and baking, which can produce delicious smells. Additionally, many people enjoy spending time in the kitchen because it is often the heart of the home. Option D, living room, is possible, but less likely than option C. While living rooms can be cozy and comfortable, they are not typically associated with strong aromas. Option E, garden, is unlikely to be the correct answer because gardens are typically outside and not a room in the house. Therefore, the most likely answer is C, kitchen.	0.012605042016806723	0.0	0.0	0.012605042016806723	0.08823529411764706	0.04201680672268908	0.07142857142857142	0.24369747899159663	0.0546218487394958	0.0	0.06302521008403361	0.07983193277310924	0.12605042016806722	0.0	0.004201680672268907	238

Next, we need to consider where people typically go to eat while shopping. One common option is a food court, which is a collection of fast food and casual dining restaurants located within a shopping mall or department store. Therefore, the most likely answer is D. food court. While it is possible to find pizzerias in other locations such as Chicago, on the street, in Little Italy, or in capital cities, the question specifically asks where you would expect to find a pizzeria while shopping, and a food court is the most common location for restaurants within a shopping environment.	0.007352941176470588	0.0	0.014705882352941176	0.04411764705882353	0.058823529411764705	0.03676470588235294	0.051470588235294115	0.25	0.07352941176470588	0.007352941176470588	0.10294117647058823	0.058823529411764705	0.11029411764705882	0.0	0.03676470588235294	136

23	Sean was lying about the body, which means he was not telling the truth. This suggests that he may have been involved in something illegal or unethical. However, the sentence also states that he was very scared. This implies that he was worried about the consequences of his actions. Option A, the reward money, does not seem relevant to the situation described in the sentence. Option B, hurt feelings, is unlikely to be the main concern of someone who is lying about a body. Option D, problems, and option E, trouble, are too vague and do not provide enough context to determine if they are correct. Therefore, the most likely answer is C, being found out.

25	"First, we know that there is a high demand for exotic snakes. This means that many people want to buy them. Next, we need to consider what is being driven to carry them. The word ""carry"" suggests that something or someone is transporting the snakes. Option A, ""ditch,"" doesn't make sense in this context. Option B, ""shop,"" could be a possibility, but it's not specific enough. What kind of shop? Option C, ""North America,"" doesn't seem relevant to the question. Option D, ""pet shops,"" is a likely answer. Pet shops are places where people can buy exotic snakes, and they would need to be carried from the breeder or supplier to the pet shop. Option E, ""outdoors,"" doesn't make sense in this context either. Therefore, the answer is D.

26	Joe stabbed a stranger to death, which is a criminal offense. Therefore, he would likely face jail time as a consequence. However, the question specifically asks about what the family of the victim did to him. It is possible that the family filed a lawsuit against Joe, seeking compensation for the loss of their loved one. However, this is not the only possible consequence. Option A, knife wounds, does not make sense as Joe was the one who did the stabbing. Option B, buying a gun, is not a consequence that the victim's family would inflict upon Joe. Option C, bleeding, is not a consequence that the victim's family would cause intentionally.

27	The question mentions preventing glare during a football game, which suggests that the person is watching the game on a screen. Therefore, option A, television, seems like the most likely answer. Option B, attic, and option E, ground, do not make sense in the context of preventing glare on a screen. Option C, corner, could potentially refer to a corner of the room where the screen is located, but it is not clear how cleaning this area would prevent glare.

31	First, the camper would need to find a suitable location for cooking, which may involve setting up a campsite or finding a designated cooking area. Next, the camper would need to gather any necessary cooking equipment, such as a stove, fuel, pots and pans, utensils, and food. If the camper plans to cook over an open flame, they would need to gather firewood and kindling and start a fire in a safe and responsible manner. Once the cooking area is set up and the necessary equipment is gathered, the camper can begin preparing and cooking their food. Therefore, the correct answer is C. pack or bag, as the camper would need to gather and organize their cooking equipment before they can start cooking food.	0.02127659574468085	0.0	0.0	0.028368794326241134	0.07092198581560284	0.014184397163120567	0.02127659574468085	0.23404255319148937	0.05673758865248227	0.0	0.16312056737588654	0.05673758865248227	0.12056737588652482	0.0	0.02127659574468085	141
32	If you leave a paper outside, it is likely to be exposed to various environmental factors such as sunlight, wind, rain, and humidity. Over time, the paper may become saturated with water if it rains or if there is high humidity. This can cause the paper to become wrinkled or even disintegrate. Additionally, exposure to sunlight can cause the paper to fade or discolor. If the paper is not protected from the wind, it may also become ripped or torn.

33	"First, we need to understand what a vasectomy is. A vasectomy is a surgical procedure for male sterilization or permanent contraception. During the procedure, the vas deferens, the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the urethra, are cut, tied, or sealed. This prevents sperm from reaching the semen that is ejaculated from the penis during sexual intercourse.Now, let's look at the question. Before the vasectomy, Mark's semen was described as ""very thick."" This could be an indication of a high concentration of sperm in the semen. However, after the vasectomy, the vas deferens are cut, tied, or sealed, which means that sperm cannot mix with the semen anymore. Therefore, the semen would become ""thin"" or ""clear"" because it no longer contains sperm. So, the correct answer is C. thin."	0.05421686746987952	0.0	0.006024096385542169	0.03614457831325301	0.06626506024096386	0.012048192771084338	0.05421686746987952	0.18072289156626506	0.09036144578313253	0.0	0.12048192771084337	0.060240963855421686	0.18674698795180722	0.0	0.018072289156626505	166

38	First, we need to understand what threats bald eagles face. Bald eagles are apex predators and have few natural predators, but they are still vulnerable to human activities such as habitat destruction, pollution, and hunting. Therefore, a bald eagle would be safe in a place where it is protected from these threats. Option A, a pine tree, may provide a safe perch for a bald eagle, but it does not necessarily protect it from human activities. Option B, open country, may provide good hunting grounds for a bald eagle, but it also exposes it to potential threats. Option C, in Washington, may be a safe place for a bald eagle if it is protected by laws and regulations, but it does not guarantee safety from all threats. Option D, a wildlife refuge, is the best answer because it is a protected area where wildlife is conserved and protected from human activities. Bald eagles are often found in wildlife refuges because they provide a safe habitat with minimal human disturbance. Option E, the sky, is not a safe place for a bald eagle because it is exposed to potential threats such as power lines, wind turbines, and other human activities. Therefore, the correct answer is D. wildlife refuge.	0.029411764705882353	0.0	0.004201680672268907	0.0546218487394958	0.08403361344537816	0.025210084033613446	0.029411764705882353	0.24369747899159663	0.07563025210084033	0.0	0.06722689075630252	0.13025210084033614	0.13025210084033614	0.0	0.012605042016806723	238

41	If someone eats too much dinner, their stomach will be full and may feel uncomfortable. This discomfort can lead to a stomach ache. Additionally, the body will have to work harder to digest the excess food, which can cause tiredness. Over time, consistently eating too much can lead to weight gain and potentially increase the risk of certain illnesses. It can also increase the likelihood of experiencing acid reflux, which is when stomach acid flows back up into the esophagus. Therefore, the correct answer is C. stomach ache, and other options such as A. tiredness, D. illness, and E. acid reflux can also be possible outcomes. B. living longer is not a likely result of eating too much dinner.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.022222222222222223	0.1037037037037037	0.014814814814814815	0.0962962962962963	0.2222222222222222	0.06666666666666667	0.0	0.1037037037037037	0.08148148148148149	0.11851851851851852	0.0	0.014814814814814815	135

44	First, we know that the fox was thirsty and searching for water. This means that he was in a place where there was no water readily available. A. Painting: It is unlikely that a fox would be searching for water in a painting. B. Hen house: While there may be water available in a hen house, it is not a place where a fox would typically be welcome or able to access easily. C. California: This answer is possible, as California has experienced droughts in the past. However, it is not specific enough to determine if the fox was actually in California. D. Virginia: Again, this answer is possible, but not specific enough to determine if the fox was actually in Virginia. E.

54	A grumpy person is likely to have a headache because they may be feeling irritable, frustrated, or stressed, which can lead to physical tension and discomfort. They are unlikely to understand themselves well because their negative mood may cloud their self-awareness and ability to reflect on their emotions. Compliments are also unlikely as they may not be in a receptive state of mind to receive positive feedback. Owning a house or having happiness are not necessarily related to being grumpy. Therefore, the answer is A. headache.	0.020618556701030927	0.0	0.0	0.07216494845360824	0.13402061855670103	0.020618556701030927	0.041237113402061855	0.18556701030927836	0.061855670103092786	0.0	0.10309278350515463	0.1134020618556701	0.10309278350515463	0.0	0.0	97

56	First, we need to understand what a beaver dam is and how it can affect machines. A beaver dam is a structure built by beavers using branches, logs, and mud to create a barrier across a river or stream. This creates a pond or lake behind the dam, which can flood the surrounding area.Now, let's look at the options. A strip club or pocket have nothing to do with beaver dams or machines, so we can eliminate those options. Ontario is a province in Canada and also has nothing to do with beaver dams or machines, so we can eliminate that option as well.That leaves us with two options: millpond and lake or river. A millpond is a man-made pond created by damming a river or stream to power a mill. If a beaver were to build a dam in a millpond, it could disrupt the flow of water to the mill and potentially damage the machinery, so this could be a correct answer.However, the most likely answer is E. Lake or river. If a beaver builds a dam in a natural lake or river, it can cause flooding and disrupt the flow of water, which can affect machines such as hydroelectric power plants, irrigation systems, and water treatment facilities. So, the correct answer is E. Lake or river.	0.015810276679841896	0.0	0.015810276679841896	0.043478260869565216	0.07905138339920949	0.023715415019762844	0.03557312252964427	0.2608695652173913	0.05928853754940711	0.003952569169960474	0.09486166007905138	0.023715415019762844	0.11462450592885376	0.0	0.023715415019762844	253

58	First, we need to consider where sunlight cannot reach. This would eliminate options B, C, and D as they are all exposed to sunlight in some way. Next, we need to consider where fungi typically grow. Fungi thrive in moist and dark environments, which would eliminate option A as under rocks may not always be moist. This leaves us with option E, fallen tree, as a possible answer. Fallen trees provide a moist and dark environment for fungi to grow without being disturbed by sunlight. Therefore, the correct answer is E. fallen tree.	0.03669724770642202	0.0	0.027522935779816515	0.03669724770642202	0.07339449541284404	0.01834862385321101	0.05504587155963303	0.21100917431192662	0.10091743119266056	0.0	0.14678899082568808	0.05504587155963303	0.13761467889908258	0.0	0.01834862385321101	109

70	The question states that Jamie wanted to reduce her waist size, but all of her efforts failed miserably. This means that she did not succeed in reducing her waist size. Therefore, we can eliminate options A, B, D, and E, as they all suggest that Jamie's waist size increased or remained the same. This leaves us with option C, which means to lose hope or become discouraged. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

71	First, James is losing consciousness. This means he is losing awareness of his surroundings and his own thoughts. This can be a scary experience for anyone. Next, James is frightened. This means he is experiencing fear, which is a natural response to a perceived threat or danger. Then, James doesn't want this. This means he is resisting the loss of consciousness and wants to remain conscious. Putting all of this together, we can infer that James is scared of losing control and potentially losing his life.

72	If someone is aloof, it means they are distant and reserved in their interactions with others. They may not show much interest in getting to know new people or making friends. If someone is self-important, it means they have an inflated sense of their own importance and may come across as arrogant or condescending. Putting these two traits together, it's likely that someone who is aloof and self-important would not have a positive experience when meeting new people. They may feel bored or disinterested in getting to know others, or they may feel like they are above socializing with certain people. They may not smile or show much warmth, which could make others feel uncomfortable or unwelcome.

73	The man tripped over a metal rod while building, so we can eliminate options C and E (engine and shops) as they don't involve building. The man received workman's compensation, which suggests that he was injured on the job. This eliminates option A (factory) as it's unlikely that a metal rod would be present in a factory setting that would cause such an injury. This leaves us with options B (construction site) and D (insides of skyscraper's walls). Both of these options involve building and could potentially have metal rods present that could cause an injury. However, given that the man tripped over the metal rod, it's more likely that he was on a construction site where there may be more debris and hazards on the ground.

Option C is a possibility if the person is reading in a classroom, but it is not a general answer to the question. Option D is a common location for reading, but it doesn't answer the question of where the book is kept while not being read.

78	"The sentence states that the person ""loved buying products"" and was ""driven by her what to shop more than any practical needs."" This suggests that the person is motivated by something other than practicality or necessity. Option A, desire, fits this description well. It implies a strong urge or craving to buy products, which is not necessarily based on practical needs. Option B, money, is not a likely answer because the sentence does not suggest that the person is motivated by financial gain or savings. Option C, time, is also unlikely because it does not make sense for someone to be driven to shop more because of time constraints. Option D, credit, could be a possible answer if the person is motivated by the ability to use credit to buy products, but it is not as strong of an answer as desire. Option E, spending money, is similar to option D and could be a possible answer, but again, desire seems like a stronger fit based on the sentence. Therefore, the answer is A. desire."	0.04433497536945813	0.0	0.0	0.034482758620689655	0.08374384236453201	0.034482758620689655	0.029556650246305417	0.23645320197044334	0.06403940886699508	0.0	0.10344827586206896	0.06896551724137931	0.13793103448275862	0.0	0.0	203

Option A, wasteland, doesn't make sense because the community garden was already there, so it couldn't have been turned into a wasteland. Option B, ocean, is unlikely because cities don't usually build gardens near oceans, and even if they did, it wouldn't make sense to demolish a garden to make way for an ocean. Option C, desert, is also unlikely because cities don't usually build gardens in deserts, and even if they did, it wouldn't make sense to demolish a garden to make way for a desert. Option D, parking lot, is the most likely answer because cities often need more parking spaces, and they might demolish a garden to build a parking lot.

The other options (demonstration, conference, garage, mouth) do not fit the context of someone living in a place."	0.028985507246376812	0.0	0.036231884057971016	0.07971014492753623	0.07246376811594203	0.021739130434782608	0.021739130434782608	0.2028985507246377	0.10144927536231885	0.0	0.13043478260869565	0.050724637681159424	0.15217391304347827	0.0	0.014492753623188406	138
88	The question mentions that the skin was cut while chopping onions. This means that the person was using a knife to chop the onions. Therefore, the skin that was likely cut is on the hand that was holding the onion or the hand that was holding the knife. Option B, finger, is the most likely answer as it is the part of the hand that is most commonly cut while using a knife. Options A, C, D, and E are not relevant to the question and can be eliminated.	0.09	0.0	0.0	0.05	0.12	0.04	0.05	0.2	0.04	0.0	0.12	0.02	0.11	0.0	0.0	100
89	After doing housework for hours, you might feel physically tired and exhausted. You may also feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction for completing the tasks. However, you may also feel stressed if you have a lot of other responsibilities to attend to or if the housework was particularly challenging.

90	The accountant used a calculator regularly, so he would need to have one easily accessible. The question states that he kept one at home, so we can eliminate options C, D, and E. The question also doesn't mention anything about the accountant having a specific job or workplace, so we can eliminate option A. That leaves us with option B, desktop, which makes sense as the accountant may have kept a calculator on his work desk for easy access.

92	The question states that you are not glad, unhappy, or gloomy. This means that you are not experiencing any extreme emotions. Therefore, it is unlikely that you have an illness related to mood disorders such as depression or anxiety. Option C, angry, is also unlikely as anger is a specific emotion and not a general state of being. Option D, unhappy, is already mentioned in the question and is not a separate illness. Option E, sorrowful, is similar to being gloomy and is also not a separate illness. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be A, depressed, as it is a general term used to describe a range of mood disorders that can cause a persistent feeling of sadness or loss of interest in activities. However, it is important to note that a proper diagnosis can only be made by a qualified healthcare professional.	0.024242424242424242	0.0	0.0	0.04242424242424243	0.11515151515151516	0.024242424242424242	0.048484848484848485	0.17575757575757575	0.07272727272727272	0.0	0.05454545454545454	0.14545454545454545	0.12727272727272726	0.0	0.0	165
93	The question is asking about hearing testimony of how spirituality changes lives. This suggests that someone is sharing their personal experience of how their spirituality has impacted their life. Option A, going to church, is a common way for people to practice their spirituality and connect with others who share their beliefs. However, simply going to church does not guarantee that you will hear testimony of how spirituality changes lives. Option B, appearing in court, is not relevant to the question and does not relate to spirituality. Option C, watching soap operas, is also not relevant to the question and does not relate to spirituality. Option D, paying attention, is a general statement that could apply to many situations. However, it is possible that by paying attention to someone's story or testimony, you could hear about how their spirituality has changed their life. Option E, going into court, is similar to option B and is not relevant to the question. Therefore, the best answer is D, paying attention. By actively listening and being present in the moment, you may have the opportunity to hear someone's testimony of how their spirituality has impacted their life.	0.013452914798206279	0.0	0.0	0.08071748878923767	0.09865470852017937	0.03587443946188341	0.026905829596412557	0.21973094170403587	0.1031390134529148	0.0	0.13452914798206278	0.053811659192825115	0.1210762331838565	0.0	0.0	223
94	"The sentence states that ""she had never felt this much"" in the morning. This means that she is feeling something that she has never felt before in the morning. Option A, ""active,"" could be a possibility, as she may feel energized and ready to start the day after a good rest. Option B, ""hunger,"" does not make sense in this context, as the sentence is referring to how she feels after a rest, not how hungry she is. Option C, ""in motion,"" also does not make sense in this context, as the sentence is not referring to her physical movement. Option D, ""wakefulness,"" could be a possibility, as she may feel more alert and awake after a good rest. Option E, ""lay down,"" does not make sense in this context, as the sentence is referring to how she feels in the morning, not what she did before going to bed.

95	First, we need to identify which temple is being referred to. Without that information, it is difficult to determine which region has the most famous temple. If we assume that the question is referring to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, then the answer would be A. Jerusalem. The Temple Mount is home to several important religious sites, including the Western Wall and the Dome of the Rock, making it one of the most famous religious sites in the world. However, if the question is referring to a different temple, such as the Angkor Wat in Cambodia or the Golden Temple in India, then the answer would be different. Therefore, without more specific information, it is impossible to give a definitive answer to this question.	0.007142857142857143	0.0	0.014285714285714285	0.03571428571428571	0.08571428571428572	0.02142857142857143	0.05714285714285714	0.12142857142857143	0.1	0.007142857142857143	0.07142857142857142	0.09285714285714286	0.11428571428571428	0.0	0.07142857142857142	140

97	First, we need to find a place inside the house. Option A (roof) is not a practical solution as it is not safe and not accessible. Option B (school) and C (beach) are not relevant to the question. That leaves us with options D (closet) and E (garage). Both are viable options, but it depends on the size of the folding chair and the available space in the house. If the folding chair is small and can fit in a closet, then option D is the best choice. However, if the folding chair is larger and there is no space in the closet, then option E (garage) would be the better choice. Therefore, the answer is either D (closet) or E (garage), depending on the size of the folding chair and the available space in the house.	0.0	0.0	0.011904761904761904	0.02976190476190476	0.07142857142857142	0.011904761904761904	0.02976190476190476	0.21428571428571427	0.07142857142857142	0.0	0.05952380952380952	0.06547619047619048	0.18452380952380953	0.0	0.005952380952380952	168
98	First, we know that the topic of discussion is getting a divorce. This means that the person is trying to end a legal relationship. Option B, sisters, is not a legal relationship that can be ended through a divorce. Option D, two people, is too broad and does not specify a legal relationship. Option E, lawyer, is not a relationship status that can be ended through a divorce. This leaves us with options A and C, both of which involve the legal relationship of marriage. However, option C specifically mentions marriage, so the correct answer is C.	0.017699115044247787	0.0	0.017699115044247787	0.035398230088495575	0.09734513274336283	0.02654867256637168	0.035398230088495575	0.22123893805309736	0.05309734513274336	0.008849557522123894	0.09734513274336283	0.05309734513274336	0.1415929203539823	0.0	0.02654867256637168	113

100	First, we know that John was punching at the wall and ended up bloodying his knuckles. This suggests that he was using his fists to punch. Next, the passage tells us that this was bad because he would be unable to hold his tools if he injured something. This implies that John needs his hands to hold tools.

101	"The small dog felt like it had all the space in the world, which means it felt very comfortable and unrestricted. However, it stayed strictly indoors, which means it did not have access to the outdoors. Therefore, the answer cannot be B, dog park. The options left are A, living room, C, basket, D, small apartment, and E, big house. It is unlikely that the small dog would feel like it had all the space in the world in a basket, so we can eliminate option C. Option D, small apartment, seems unlikely as well since the word ""small"" implies limited space. This leaves us with options A, living room, and E, big house. While a living room can be spacious, it is still just one room in a house. On the other hand, a big house would provide the small dog with multiple rooms and areas to explore, making it more likely that it would feel like it had all the space in the world. Therefore, the answer is E, big house."	0.038461538461538464	0.0	0.009615384615384616	0.057692307692307696	0.08173076923076923	0.02403846153846154	0.04807692307692308	0.20673076923076922	0.057692307692307696	0.004807692307692308	0.07211538461538461	0.09134615384615384	0.16346153846153846	0.0	0.004807692307692308	208
102	Depression is a mental health condition that can lead to a range of negative emotions and behaviors. In severe cases, depression can lead to suicidal thoughts and actions, which can ultimately result in death by suicide (A). Overdosing on drugs or alcohol is also a potential risk for individuals struggling with depression (B). Sadness (C) is a symptom of depression, but it is not a direct cause of death. Murder (D) is not typically associated with depression, although it is possible for someone with depression to be a victim of homicide. Cyanide (E) is not typically associated with depression or suicide, although it is a toxic substance that can cause death in high doses.

104	First, we need to consider where lizards are commonly found. Lizards are cold-blooded reptiles that are often found in warm and dry environments, such as deserts, rocky areas, and sunny open spaces. Next, we need to think about where a person might encounter a lizard unexpectedly. This could be in a place where they are not typically found, or in a situation where the person is not expecting to see a lizard. Based on these factors, the most likely answer would be A. New Mexico, as it is a state known for its desert landscapes and high population of lizards.

105	"The sentence states that ""he wasn't hosting,"" which means he was going to someone else's place. The sentence also mentions that he brought plenty of food with him. This suggests that he was going to a place where people were gathering to eat and watch the game. Option A, picnic, doesn't fit because it implies an outdoor setting, and the sentence doesn't mention anything about being outside. Option B, friend's house, is the most likely answer because it fits with the idea of going to someone else's place. Option C, table, is too vague and doesn't provide any context for where the table might be. Option D, space shuttle, is obviously not a realistic option. Option E, fairgrounds, doesn't fit because it implies a large public space, and the sentence suggests a more intimate gathering.

112	"First, we need to identify the context of the situation. The question mentions ""religious speech,"" which suggests that this is a religious gathering or event. Next, we need to consider the setting. The options given are: auditorium, office, synagogue, confession, and church. An auditorium is a large room or building used for public events, so it could be a possibility. However, it doesn't necessarily have a religious connotation. An office is a workplace, so it's unlikely that many people would be sitting in chairs and listening to a religious speech there. A synagogue is a Jewish place of worship, so it's possible that people would be sitting and listening to a religious speech there. Confession is a Catholic sacrament where a person confesses their sins to a priest, so it's unlikely that many people would be sitting and listening to a religious speech there. A church is a Christian place of worship, and it's very likely that many people would be sitting in chairs and listening to a religious speech there.

113	First, we need to understand what a tabby cat is. A tabby cat is a type of domestic cat with a distinctive coat pattern of stripes, dots, or swirling patterns. Next, we need to consider the characteristics of a tabby cat. Tabby cats are known to be friendly, affectionate, and playful. They also enjoy being around people and other animals. Based on these characteristics, we can eliminate options C and E (alley and barn) as they are not environments where a tabby cat would have regular human interaction. Option A (box) may provide some entertainment for a tabby cat, but it is not a suitable long-term living environment. Option D (lap) is a good choice as tabby cats enjoy being close to their owners and receiving attention. However, it may not be practical for the cat to spend all its time on someone's lap. Therefore, the best answer is B (home). A tabby cat is likely to be happiest in a loving home environment where it can receive attention, play, and have a comfortable living space.	0.009523809523809525	0.0	0.014285714285714285	0.05714285714285714	0.09523809523809523	0.009523809523809525	0.023809523809523808	0.23333333333333334	0.06190476190476191	0.0	0.07142857142857142	0.11904761904761904	0.1523809523809524	0.0	0.009523809523809525	210

117	First, we know that there weren't potatoes. This implies that the person was expecting potatoes. Next, we know that there was actually a snake. This means that the person found something unexpected in their original expectation of potatoes. Based on these clues, we can eliminate options D and E (pet shops and deep grass) as they don't fit the context of the sentence. Option C (purse) is unlikely as it's not a common place to store potatoes. Option B (hot country) could be a possibility, but it doesn't provide any context as to why there would be a snake instead of potatoes. Therefore, the most likely answer is A (burlap sack), as it's a common container for potatoes and could easily conceal a snake.	0.033112582781456956	0.0	0.019867549668874173	0.07947019867549669	0.09933774834437085	0.033112582781456956	0.046357615894039736	0.2052980132450331	0.0728476821192053	0.0	0.07947019867549669	0.059602649006622516	0.1456953642384106	0.0	0.006622516556291391	151
118	Listening to music can cause you to feel happy because it can trigger the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward. It can also cause you to smile because it can evoke positive emotions and memories. Additionally, listening to music can cause you to feel calm and relaxed because it can slow down your heart rate and breathing, reducing stress and anxiety. Finally, listening to music can provide entertainment and serve as a form of relaxation.

119	First, we need to consider the physics of throwing a rock into a river. The goal is to create a big splash, which means we want the rock to hit the water at a high velocity and at a steep angle. Option A, mountains countryside, and option D, mountain range, are not ideal because the rock would likely lose velocity and angle before hitting the river. Option B, ground, could work if you are standing on a high cliff or ledge overlooking the river. Option C, bridge, is a good choice because it provides a high vantage point and a clear path for the rock to hit the water at a steep angle. Option E, surface of earth, is not specific enough to determine the best location for throwing the rock. Therefore, the best answer is C, bridge.	0.0	0.0	0.012578616352201259	0.025157232704402517	0.050314465408805034	0.018867924528301886	0.025157232704402517	0.25157232704402516	0.06289308176100629	0.0	0.1069182389937107	0.07547169811320754	0.1320754716981132	0.0	0.006289308176100629	159

121	"The sentence states that the new play was the go-to performance of the year. This means that it was highly popular and well-received. The next part of the sentence says that ""all the crowds would stand."" This suggests that the audience was showing some kind of positive reaction to the play. Option A, admiration, could be a possible answer, as standing could be a sign of respect or appreciation. However, the sentence doesn't explicitly state that the crowds were admiring the play. Option B, applaud, seems like a more likely answer. When people stand and clap, it's usually a sign of approval or enjoyment. This would make sense if the play was the go-to performance of the year. Option C, make reservations, doesn't really fit with the rest of the sentence. It's not clear why the crowds would stand and then make reservations. Option D, experience, is a bit vague. It's possible that the crowds were standing to fully experience the play, but this doesn't give us a clear idea of what they were experiencing. Option E, sleep, is clearly not the answer. It doesn't make sense for crowds to stand and sleep during a play.

""Sights"" generally refers to the aiming mechanism on a firearm, so that is not the correct answer. ""Optical illusion"" refers to a perception of something that is not actually there, so that is also not the correct answer. ""Optical telescope"" is a type of telescope that uses lenses or mirrors to gather and focus light, and it often has an eyepiece for observation. This is a possible answer, but it is not specific enough to the act of looking through an eyepiece. ""Light microscope"" is a type of microscope that uses visible light to magnify small objects, and it also has an eyepiece for observation. This is a possible answer, but it is also not specific enough to the act of looking through an eyepiece. ""Binocular"" refers to a pair of handheld optical devices that have two eyepieces for observation. This is not the correct answer because it implies the use of two eyepieces, whereas the question only mentions one.

This suggests that the missing word should describe the decorations in a positive way, as the first part of the sentence already established that they were well done. Option A, ""terrible,"" and option D, ""small,"" both have negative connotations and do not fit with the positive tone of the sentence. Option C, ""Halloween,"" is not a descriptive word and does not provide any information about the decorations themselves. This leaves us with options B, ""little,"" and E, ""horrible.""

151	First, we need to understand what an unpleasing fashion means. It means that the bassoon is being played in a way that is not enjoyable to listen to. Next, we need to consider where a bassoon is typically played. A bassoon is a member of the woodwind family and is often played in orchestras, symphonies, and bands. Based on this information, the most likely answer would be E. high school band. This is because high school bands may not have the same level of skill and experience as professional orchestras or symphonies, and therefore, the bassoon may be played in an unpleasing fashion. However, it's important to note that this is not always the case and there are many talented high school musicians who can play the bassoon beautifully.	0.034482758620689655	0.0	0.013793103448275862	0.05517241379310345	0.11724137931034483	0.027586206896551724	0.06206896551724138	0.2	0.05517241379310345	0.0	0.0896551724137931	0.08275862068965517	0.10344827586206896	0.0	0.006896551724137931	145

157	The question is asking about the hope of playing sports without competition. So, we need to consider what playing sports without competition means. It means playing for the sake of playing, without the pressure of winning or losing. Option A, running, is a physical activity that can be done without competition, but it doesn't necessarily apply to all sports. Option B, having fun, is a common reason for playing sports without competition. People can enjoy the physical activity and the social aspect of playing with others. Option C, balls touching, is not a valid reason for playing sports without competition. Option D, winning, is not applicable in this scenario since there is no competition. Option E, getting tired, is a physical outcome of playing sports, but it is not a hope or goal of playing without competition. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

159	First, we know that Joe bought a ficus. A ficus is a type of indoor plant that is often used for decoration. Next, we are asked where Joe thought it would look good in his home. Option A, the family room, seems like a reasonable choice. The family room is a common area where people spend time together, and adding a plant could make the space feel more inviting and cozy. Option B, the tropical forest, is not a realistic choice. Most people do not have a tropical forest in their home. Option C, the flower garden, is also not a realistic choice. A ficus is an indoor plant and would not survive outside in a flower garden. Option D, the movie theater, is an unlikely choice. A ficus would not be a typical decoration in a movie theater. Option E, the hair salon, is also an unlikely choice. While some hair salons may have plants for decoration, a ficus may not be the best choice for a space with chemicals and hair products. Therefore, the most likely answer is A, the family room.	0.018691588785046728	0.0	0.009345794392523364	0.028037383177570093	0.09813084112149532	0.018691588785046728	0.04672897196261682	0.26635514018691586	0.04672897196261682	0.0	0.056074766355140186	0.0794392523364486	0.14018691588785046	0.0	0.014018691588785047	214

Next, we need to consider what piece of furniture might have been on her rug. Option A, the front of the door, is unlikely to have furniture on it. Option B, the bedroom, could have a desk or a table, but it's not clear if Sarah spilled ink in her bedroom. Option C, the desk, is the most likely answer. Desks often have inkwells, and it's common to write at a desk. Option D, the table, is also a possibility, but it's less likely than the desk. Option E, the living room, could have a coffee table or end table with an inkwell, but again, it's not clear if Sarah spilled ink in her living room.

168	John moved away from his family because he needed a job. This implies that the job was not available where he was living before. Therefore, option D, available, cannot be the correct answer. Now, let's look at the other options. John was upset about moving away from his family, so he would have preferred the job to be closer or to stay where he was. Option B, stay here, is not grammatically correct, so we can eliminate it. Option A, present, does not make sense in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is C, closer. John would have preferred the job to be closer to his family so that he could stay with them. Option E, come here, is not a viable option as it implies that John's family would move to where he is, which is not mentioned in the passage.	0.052941176470588235	0.0	0.0058823529411764705	0.08235294117647059	0.12352941176470589	0.058823529411764705	0.052941176470588235	0.13529411764705881	0.058823529411764705	0.0	0.10588235294117647	0.06470588235294118	0.14705882352941177	0.0	0.023529411764705882	170

175	First, we know that someone lacking immortality means that they are not immortal, which means they can die. So, options A, C, D, and E all refer to the fact that this person will eventually die. Option B, mortal, is a bit trickier. Mortal means that something is subject to death, so it could be a valid answer. However, it doesn't quite capture the idea that this person will definitely die one day. Therefore, the best answer is C. Dead. This option directly states that the person will no longer be alive, which is the ultimate fate of all mortals.	0.0	0.0	0.008333333333333333	0.058333333333333334	0.10833333333333334	0.058333333333333334	0.08333333333333333	0.13333333333333333	0.025	0.008333333333333333	0.09166666666666666	0.075	0.15833333333333333	0.0	0.025	120

Option C, a supermarket, could work, but it's not typically a place where you can just take items to sell without permission. That leaves us with option B, a rest area. Rest areas often have vending machines or small shops where you can purchase items to sell at a roadside stand.

185	When talking to someone, the primary goal is usually to communicate with them. This can involve sharing information, expressing thoughts or feelings, or simply engaging in conversation. Hurt feelings is not a desirable outcome when talking to someone, so option B can be eliminated. Dry mouth is a physical response that may occur during conversation, but it is not a goal or desired outcome. Therefore, option C can also be eliminated. Intimacy may be a desired outcome in certain situations, such as in a romantic relationship or close friendship, but it is not always the goal when talking to someone. Therefore, option D may not be the correct answer. Changing behavior can be a desired outcome when talking to someone, especially in a professional or educational setting. This can involve providing feedback, offering suggestions, or giving instructions. Therefore, option E is a possible answer.

D is not a storage option, and B is where you buy peanut butter, not where you store it.	0.04838709677419355	0.0	0.0	0.06451612903225806	0.0967741935483871	0.016129032258064516	0.04838709677419355	0.24193548387096775	0.04838709677419355	0.0	0.13709677419354838	0.016129032258064516	0.10483870967741936	0.0	0.0	124
197	First, we need to identify what James spent a lot of money on. The answer choices are bike, downtown, building, tool storage, and car. Out of these options, the most likely answer is E. car. This is because a garage is typically used to store a car, and it would make sense for James to need a garage if he spent a lot of money on a car. Therefore, the answer is E. car.	0.034482758620689655	0.0	0.011494252873563218	0.04597701149425287	0.06896551724137931	0.022988505747126436	0.04597701149425287	0.25287356321839083	0.08045977011494253	0.0	0.09195402298850575	0.011494252873563218	0.14942528735632185	0.0	0.034482758620689655	87

199	The friends wanted to spend a quiet evening together, so options A (wedding) and E (restaurant) may not be the best choices as they can be quite noisy and busy. Option C (internet cafe) may not be the best choice for a quiet evening either, as it can be quite distracting with all the screens and people around. Option B (friend's house) could be a good choice, but it doesn't necessarily involve going out. Therefore, the most likely answer is D (movie), as it provides a quiet and dark environment for the friends to enjoy each other's company without any distractions.	0.008130081300813009	0.0	0.0	0.032520325203252036	0.0975609756097561	0.008130081300813009	0.06504065040650407	0.1951219512195122	0.06504065040650407	0.0	0.056910569105691054	0.08943089430894309	0.15447154471544716	0.0	0.016260162601626018	123

201	The question is asking where you would sit in a chair to watch four-legged animals complete. This implies that there is some sort of competition or race involving four-legged animals. Option A, a bookstore, does not make sense as bookstores are not typically associated with animal races or competitions. Option B, a house, could potentially work if the house is located near the race track or competition area. However, the question specifically mentions sitting in a chair, which implies an outdoor setting. Option C, a race track, seems like the most logical answer as it is specifically mentioned in the question and is a common location for animal races and competitions. Option D, a friend's house, does not provide enough information to determine if it is a suitable location for watching animal races or competitions. Option E, a building, is too vague and could refer to any type of building, making it difficult to determine if it is a suitable location for watching animal races or competitions. Therefore, the answer is C, race track.	0.014778325123152709	0.0	0.0	0.029556650246305417	0.07389162561576355	0.024630541871921183	0.03940886699507389	0.26108374384236455	0.06896551724137931	0.009852216748768473	0.10344827586206896	0.054187192118226604	0.12807881773399016	0.0	0.009852216748768473	203
202	First, we need to know where lemurs are typically found. Lemurs are primates that are native to the island of Madagascar, off the coast of Africa. Therefore, we can eliminate options A, B, C, and E as they are not related to Madagascar. That leaves us with option D, field. However, lemurs are not typically found in fields. They are arboreal animals, meaning they live in trees and forests. Therefore, the correct answer would be: F.

204	First, we need to understand what reflection is. Reflection is the bouncing back of light rays from a surface. So, for us to see our reflection in a piece of wood, the wood needs to be able to reflect light.A. Burned wood is charred and blackened, which means it absorbs light instead of reflecting it. So, we cannot see our reflection in burned wood.B. Polished wood has a smooth surface that can reflect light. So, it is possible to see our reflection in polished wood.C. Carved wood has a textured surface that scatters light, making it difficult to see our reflection.D. Composted wood is decomposed and broken down, which means it cannot reflect light. So, we cannot see our reflection in composted wood.E. Nailed wood is a piece of wood with nails in it, which means it has a rough surface that scatters light. So, we cannot see our reflection in nailed wood.Therefore, the correct answer is B. polished.	0.05670103092783505	0.0	0.05670103092783505	0.1134020618556701	0.08247422680412371	0.0	0.04639175257731959	0.18556701030927836	0.07216494845360824	0.0	0.16494845360824742	0.05670103092783505	0.12886597938144329	0.0	0.02577319587628866	194
205	First, the person trips and falls, which can cause physical pain. Then, they break their leg, which can cause even more intense pain. Additionally, they are in front of a crowd, which can cause embarrassment. Therefore, the most likely emotion that people expressing themselves show when they trip in front of a crowd and break their leg is E. embarrassment.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.08450704225352113	0.07042253521126761	0.028169014084507043	0.09859154929577464	0.19718309859154928	0.056338028169014086	0.0	0.1267605633802817	0.04225352112676056	0.15492957746478872	0.0	0.014084507042253521	71
206	"The sentence mentions that the protagonist is waiting for his friend at the squash court. This means that they had a plan to meet at a specific location. However, the protagonist is worried that his friend may have misunderstood the location and gone to a different place. The sentence also mentions that the other location is at the ""other end of the public."" This suggests that the other location is also a public place. Option A, country club, and option B, rich person's house, both suggest a private location, which contradicts the idea of a public place. Therefore, we can eliminate these options. Option C, pool, is a possibility, but it doesn't necessarily fit with the context of the sentence. The sentence mentions a squash court, which is a specific type of sports facility. If the friend had gone to a pool, it would be a different type of facility. Option D, park, is a possibility. Parks are often public places and could have multiple areas that could be considered ""the other end."" However, the sentence mentions a squash court, which is not typically found in a park. Option E, fitness center, is the most likely answer. Fitness centers often have multiple areas, such as different workout rooms or courts, and could have a squash court at one end and other facilities at the other end. Additionally, fitness centers are often public places, which fits with the context of the sentence. Therefore, the answer is E. fitness center."	0.02040816326530612	0.0	0.003401360544217687	0.023809523809523808	0.09183673469387756	0.02040816326530612	0.04421768707482993	0.2619047619047619	0.061224489795918366	0.003401360544217687	0.05782312925170068	0.07482993197278912	0.14965986394557823	0.0	0.003401360544217687	294

208	Basketball can be played both indoors and outdoors, but the question asks where it is likely to be outdoors. A. High school gymnasium - This is an indoor location, so it is not likely to be outdoors. B. City - This is a broad location and could include both indoor and outdoor basketball courts. However, since the question asks where it is likely to be outdoors, we can eliminate this option. C. Park - This is a common location for outdoor basketball courts, so it is a likely answer. D. Use - This is not a location, so it can be eliminated. E. Los Angeles - This is a city and does not specify whether the basketball court is indoors or outdoors, so it can be eliminated. Therefore, the most likely answer is C.

209	A balalaika is a musical instrument, so it is unlikely to be needed for an artist junkyard. It is possible that a music store would sell balalaikas, but that doesn't necessarily mean it is needed for the store itself. Singing is a broad category, but it is possible that a balalaika could be used in certain types of singing, such as traditional Russian folk songs. A symphony typically includes a wide range of instruments, so it is possible that a balalaika could be used in a symphony, but it would depend on the specific piece of music being performed. An orchestra is similar to a symphony, but typically includes a wider range of instruments and can perform a wider range of music styles. It is possible that a balalaika could be used in an orchestra, but again, it would depend on the specific piece of music being performed. Overall, the most likely answer is either C (singing) or E (orchestra), but it would depend on the specific context.	0.03664921465968586	0.0	0.0	0.05235602094240838	0.13089005235602094	0.031413612565445025	0.031413612565445025	0.193717277486911	0.08376963350785341	0.0	0.07853403141361257	0.09947643979057591	0.11518324607329843	0.0	0.005235602094240838	191
210	First, we need to understand what type of historical items are typically found in attics. Attics are often used for storage, so it's likely that items that are no longer in use or have sentimental value are stored there. This could include old photographs, documents, clothing, and furniture.Next, we need to consider what type of home is most likely to have an attic. While many modern homes have attics, they are often smaller and less likely to be used for storage. Older homes, on the other hand, often have larger attics that were designed for storage.Therefore, the answer is B. Older houses are most likely to have an attic filled with historical items.	0.05263157894736842	0.0	0.015037593984962405	0.06015037593984962	0.12781954887218044	0.015037593984962405	0.09774436090225563	0.19548872180451127	0.06766917293233082	0.0	0.08270676691729323	0.11278195488721804	0.12781954887218044	0.0	0.015037593984962405	133
211	First, we need to understand what a microphone boom is. It is a long, adjustable arm that holds a microphone and allows it to be positioned close to the sound source. Next, we need to consider where recording an album typically takes place. While it is possible to record an album in various locations, the most common place is a recording studio. Therefore, the answer is B. recording studio.	0.012658227848101266	0.0	0.02531645569620253	0.08860759493670886	0.0759493670886076	0.02531645569620253	0.0759493670886076	0.17721518987341772	0.02531645569620253	0.0	0.13924050632911392	0.0759493670886076	0.12658227848101267	0.0	0.02531645569620253	79

213	First, we know that the person loves their TV. This suggests that they likely spend a lot of time watching it and may have a strong emotional attachment to it. Next, we consider their feelings towards the remote. A. Attached - This could be a possible answer, as the person may feel attached to the remote because it allows them to control their beloved TV. B. Nostalgic - This is less likely, as nostalgia implies a sentimental longing for something from the past. The remote is likely a current and functional tool for the person. C. Companionable - This could also be a possible answer, as the remote is a constant companion to the TV and allows the person to interact with it. D. Likely - This is not a valid answer, as it does not describe any specific feeling towards the remote. E. Close - This is similar to feeling attached or companionable, and could be a possible answer.

It suggests a more neutral or ambiguous feeling.E. helpless - This does not fit with the idea of feeling ""mighty."" It suggests a feeling of powerlessness or vulnerability.Therefore, the best answer is B. insignificant. The vast night sky made the camper feel small and insignificant in comparison, which can be a humbling and awe-inspiring experience."	0.02252252252252252	0.0	0.0	0.02702702702702703	0.06756756756756757	0.013513513513513514	0.02252252252252252	0.17117117117117117	0.08108108108108109	0.0	0.10810810810810811	0.11711711711711711	0.17117117117117117	0.0	0.009009009009009009	222
218	First, we need to determine where the USA is located. The USA is a country in North America. Next, we need to consider where apple trees grow. Apple trees can grow in many different regions, but they are commonly grown in temperate climates. Option A, Ohio, is located in the USA and is known for its apple production. Therefore, an apple from an apple tree in Ohio would not be an imported product to the USA. Option B, Washington State, is also located in the USA and is known for its apple production. Therefore, an apple from an apple tree in Washington State would not be an imported product to the USA. Option C, Alaska, is also located in the USA, but it is not known for its apple production. Therefore, an apple from an apple tree in Alaska would not be an imported product to the USA, but it may be less common. Option D, Canada, is a neighboring country to the USA and is known for its apple production. Therefore, an apple from an apple tree in Canada would be an imported product to the USA. Option E, flowers, is not related to the question and can be eliminated. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

This tells us that he had a routine and enjoyed solving puzzles. The question asks why he did crossword puzzles every morning. Option A, ""you're bored,"" is not a strong answer because it does not explain why the old man specifically chose to do crossword puzzles. Option B, ""pass time,"" is a possibility, but it does not fully capture the old man's motivation. Option C, ""relax,"" is a strong answer because it suggests that the old man found solving crossword puzzles to be a calming and enjoyable activity. Option D, ""mentally challenged,"" is not a good answer because it has a negative connotation and implies that the old man was struggling with cognitive decline. Option E, ""win,"" is not a good answer because there is no indication that the old man was competitive or focused on winning.

220	First, it's important to understand why the person doesn't like learning. Is it because they find it boring or difficult? Is it because they have had negative experiences in the past? Once the reason is identified, the learning process can be tailored to address those specific issues.For example, if the person finds learning boring, the process can be made more interesting by incorporating hands-on activities, real-life examples, and interactive technology. If the person finds learning difficult, the process can be broken down into smaller, more manageable steps and personalized support can be provided.In addition, making the learning process fun and joyful can help to engage the person and make them more motivated to learn. This can be achieved through gamification, rewards, and positive reinforcement.Ultimately, it's important to emphasize the importance of learning and how it can benefit the person in their personal and professional life. By highlighting the relevance and practical applications of what they are learning, the person may be more willing to engage in the process. Additionally, making learning accessible and affordable (i.e. free) can remove barriers and make it more appealing.	0.03167420814479638	0.0	0.0	0.058823529411764705	0.1085972850678733	0.027149321266968326	0.04072398190045249	0.16289592760180996	0.058823529411764705	0.0	0.13574660633484162	0.1085972850678733	0.13122171945701358	0.004524886877828055	0.004524886877828055	221

Boredom and teachers are not necessary for proper instruction, and inspiration may be helpful but is not essential.This leaves us with options B and C. While time is important for planning and preparing lessons, it is not the most crucial factor in instructing children. Patience, on the other hand, is essential for working with children who may have different learning styles, abilities, and behaviors.Therefore, the correct answer is B. patience.	0.0	0.0	0.03361344537815126	0.05042016806722689	0.1092436974789916	0.025210084033613446	0.03361344537815126	0.17647058823529413	0.07563025210084033	0.0	0.1092436974789916	0.08403361344537816	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.025210084033613446	119

228	The woman was picking apples from a tree. This means she was in an orchard or a place where apple trees grow. She was surrounded by other trees, which means there were other types of trees around her. A. Illinois, New York, and Indiana are all states and do not provide any information about the location of the woman. B. Woods could be a possibility, but it is not specific enough. E. A farmer's market is a place where fruits and vegetables are sold, not grown. Therefore, the most likely answer is that the woman was in an orchard or a place where apple trees grow. The answer is not provided in the options given, but if we had to choose one, the closest would be B. woods.	0.07586206896551724	0.0	0.006896551724137931	0.041379310344827586	0.11724137931034483	0.034482758620689655	0.020689655172413793	0.2	0.06206896551724138	0.006896551724137931	0.08275862068965517	0.034482758620689655	0.1103448275862069	0.0	0.027586206896551724	145
229	First, we need to consider where a loose dictionary would typically be kept. It is a book, so it would make sense to put it on a shelf or in a library. However, if the dictionary is being used for a specific purpose, such as studying or writing, it may be more practical to keep it on a desk or table. Given that the question is asking where a mom would put the loose dictionary while tidying a house, we can assume that she is not using it for a specific purpose at the moment. Therefore, the most logical answer would be A. shelf or B. library, depending on where the other books are kept in the house.	0.030534351145038167	0.0	0.015267175572519083	0.06870229007633588	0.11450381679389313	0.061068702290076333	0.04580152671755725	0.16793893129770993	0.06870229007633588	0.0	0.12213740458015267	0.061068702290076333	0.09923664122137404	0.0	0.022900763358778626	131
230	First, we know that the man was guilty. This means that he did something wrong and was found responsible for it. Next, we know that the judge did not take this part of the job lightly. This suggests that the judge was taking the responsibility of passing sentence very seriously. Finally, we are told that it was the passing of sentence that condemned the man to something. Putting all of this together, we can eliminate options C and E (intercourse and judgement) as they do not make sense in this context. Option A (go to jail) and option B (incarceration) are both possible outcomes of passing sentence, but they do not necessarily condemn the man to anything beyond serving time in jail. This leaves us with option D (death) as the most likely answer. If the judge passed a sentence of death, then the man would be condemned to die as a result of his actions. Therefore, the answer is D.	0.05945945945945946	0.0	0.02702702702702703	0.08108108108108109	0.07567567567567568	0.032432432432432434	0.05945945945945946	0.2	0.0972972972972973	0.0	0.11351351351351352	0.02702702702702703	0.12972972972972974	0.0	0.010810810810810811	185
231	Simon bought a cow because he wanted to put it to work, which means he wants to use the cow for some kind of labor. This rules out options C and D, as dairy farms use cows for milk production and butcher shops use cows for meat production. Next, we can eliminate option E, as the location of Canada is not relevant to the question. This leaves us with options A and B. Since Simon wants to put the cow to work, it is more likely that he would take it to the countryside where there is more space for the cow to roam and potentially do farm work. Therefore, the answer is A. countryside.	0.015873015873015872	0.0	0.015873015873015872	0.07142857142857142	0.05555555555555555	0.031746031746031744	0.031746031746031744	0.23015873015873015	0.10317460317460317	0.0	0.1349206349206349	0.023809523809523808	0.0873015873015873	0.0	0.03968253968253968	126

Option A is a possible answer.If they don't find anything to do while walking, they may decide to change their shoes or clothes to feel more comfortable. Option B is also a possible answer.Alternatively, they may decide to play a game with their friends or siblings. Playing tag is a common game that children enjoy, so option C is a possible answer.If they smell smoke, they should immediately alert an adult and evacuate the area. Option D is not a suitable answer.Finally, reaching over could mean different things depending on the context, so option E is not a clear answer.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.09210526315789473	0.11842105263157894	0.039473684210526314	0.05263157894736842	0.18421052631578946	0.02631578947368421	0.0	0.11842105263157894	0.06578947368421052	0.11842105263157894	0.0	0.006578947368421052	152
233	Canned goods are usually kept in a small space that is designated for food storage. This space is typically located in the kitchen. In the kitchen, there are several options for storing canned goods. One option is a cabinet, which is a type of storage unit that is typically mounted on the wall or built into the kitchen cabinetry. Another option is a pantry, which is a small room or closet that is used for storing food items. A cupboard is another type of storage unit that is typically used for storing dishes, glasses, and other kitchen items. While canned goods could potentially be stored in a cupboard, it is not the most common location for them. Finally, a shelf is a flat surface that is used for storing items. While canned goods could be stored on a shelf, they are typically kept in a more enclosed space to protect them from dust and other contaminants. Therefore, the most likely answer to this question is B. pantry.	0.07526881720430108	0.0	0.0	0.053763440860215055	0.11290322580645161	0.010752688172043012	0.05913978494623656	0.24193548387096775	0.0967741935483871	0.005376344086021506	0.10215053763440861	0.053763440860215055	0.10215053763440861	0.0	0.010752688172043012	186

235	First, we need to consider the population density of each location. Idaho may not have a high enough population to support a large department store. In-town locations may have limited space and may not attract as many customers as a larger city. Next, we need to consider the accessibility of the location. A shopping mall may be a good option as it attracts a large number of shoppers and provides easy access to parking and public transportation. Finally, we need to consider the competition in the area. A big city like New York may have a lot of competition from other department stores, while a smaller town may not have enough demand to support a new store. Based on these factors, the best option for maximizing potential customers would be to build a new department store in a shopping mall.	0.012903225806451613	0.0	0.01935483870967742	0.025806451612903226	0.08387096774193549	0.0064516129032258064	0.025806451612903226	0.24516129032258063	0.09032258064516129	0.0	0.0967741935483871	0.10967741935483871	0.09032258064516129	0.0	0.01935483870967742	155

If it's a soccer ball, option E (soccer game) or option D (toy store) would be good choices. If it's a basketball, option D (toy store) or option C (street) might be better. If it's a tennis ball, option D (toy store) or option A (kitchen) could work.Overall, option D (toy store) is a good general choice for getting a ball of any type.	0.007407407407407408	0.0	0.022222222222222223	0.05925925925925926	0.08888888888888889	0.02962962962962963	0.014814814814814815	0.31851851851851853	0.02962962962962963	0.0	0.05925925925925926	0.037037037037037035	0.2222222222222222	0.014814814814814815	0.007407407407407408	135
237	First, we need to identify a chemical reaction that produces heat. One common example is combustion, which occurs when a fuel (such as coal or wood) reacts with oxygen to produce heat, light, and various gases. Option A mentions coal or wood, which are fuels that undergo combustion to produce heat. Option B mentions fire, which is also a result of combustion.

242	First, we need to consider what type of game the children are playing. If it's a board game or card game, they may play it at a table in their family room or dining room. If it's an outdoor game, they may play it in a park or playground. If it's a video game, they may play it in their family room or at a friend's house. Therefore, the most likely answer is E. family room or a park/playground.

244	Air that has been breathed by only a few people recently would be found in a place where there are only a few people present. A train station and a cricket stadium are both public places where many people gather, so they are unlikely to have air that has been breathed by only a few people recently. A cupboard is a small enclosed space, but unless it has been sealed for a long time, it is unlikely to have air that has been breathed by only a few people recently. The surface of the earth is too broad and open to have air that has been breathed by only a few people recently. Therefore, the most likely answer is B. house, as it is a closed space where only a few people live and breathe.	0.08275862068965517	0.0	0.0	0.06206896551724138	0.15862068965517243	0.027586206896551724	0.09655172413793103	0.16551724137931034	0.05517241379310345	0.0	0.07586206896551724	0.1103448275862069	0.06896551724137931	0.0	0.006896551724137931	145
245	When a company is bankrupt, it means that it is unable to pay its debts and obligations. The first step is usually to file for bankruptcy protection, which can give the company time to restructure and try to get back on its feet. If the company is unable to recover, it may be liquidated, which means that its assets are sold off to pay its creditors. In this case, the company ceases to exist. Alternatively, the company may be restructured or sold to a new owner, who may try to turn it around. In some cases, the company may continue to operate under new management or with new financing. Committing a crime is not a typical outcome of bankruptcy, and it is not a viable solution for a struggling company. So, the most likely answer is A. liquidated, but there are other possible outcomes depending on the specific circumstances of the company and its bankruptcy.	0.028735632183908046	0.0	0.0	0.06896551724137931	0.09195402298850575	0.022988505747126436	0.028735632183908046	0.1781609195402299	0.07471264367816093	0.0	0.13793103448275862	0.07471264367816093	0.10919540229885058	0.0	0.005747126436781609	174

248	"First, we need to identify what kind of sign we are looking for. The description mentions ""some people lined up next to it,"" which suggests that it is likely a sign indicating a place where people gather or wait in line. A. A bus stop is a possible location for this kind of sign, as people often line up to wait for buses. B. A street corner is less likely, as there may be signs indicating street names or directions, but not necessarily a sign with people lined up next to it. C. A roadblock is also unlikely, as this type of sign would likely indicate a detour or closure, rather than a place where people gather. D. A fast food drive-thru may have a sign indicating where to line up, but it is less likely to have people lined up next to the sign itself. E. ""City"" is too broad of a category to determine whether or not a sign with people lined up next to it would be present.

255	First, we know that Jimmy's wife is an alcoholic on probation, which means she is likely not allowed to consume alcohol. Therefore, Jimmy cannot bring alcohol into their home. Option A, going to a neighbor's house, may not be a good idea if the neighbor is also drinking or if Jimmy's wife has a history of causing disturbances in the neighborhood. Option B, going to a bridge, does not seem relevant to the situation and is not a logical solution. Option D, going to a homeless shelter, also does not seem relevant to the situation and is not a logical solution. Option E, going to prison, is not a viable option for someone who simply wants to have a beer. Therefore, the best answer is C, staying at home and refraining from drinking alcohol out of respect for his wife's situation. Alternatively, Jimmy could go to a bar or restaurant to have a beer, but he should not bring alcohol back to his home if his wife is on probation for alcohol-related issues.	0.009852216748768473	0.0	0.0049261083743842365	0.04433497536945813	0.08866995073891626	0.019704433497536946	0.04433497536945813	0.22167487684729065	0.09852216748768473	0.0	0.09852216748768473	0.03940886699507389	0.11822660098522167	0.0	0.024630541871921183	203

260	"Jimmy didn't like going to the party. This means that he didn't enjoy the experience. The question asks what the guys at the party did nothing but. The phrase ""nothing but"" implies that they only did one thing. A. Dance: This could be a possibility, but it doesn't necessarily mean that Jimmy didn't like it. B. Getting drunk: This seems like a more likely possibility. If the guys were only focused on getting drunk, it could have made Jimmy uncomfortable or bored. C. Meet new people: This could be a possibility, but it doesn't necessarily mean that Jimmy didn't like it. D. Having fun: This is too general of a statement. It doesn't give any specific information about what the guys were doing. E. Have fun: This is the same as option D. It's too general and doesn't give any specific information.

262	First, we need to understand what a special ficus is. Ficus is a genus of plants that includes many species of trees, shrubs, and vines. So, a special ficus could refer to a specific species of ficus that is rare, unique, or highly valued.Now, where would such a plant be found? Option A, botanical garden, seems like a good possibility. Botanical gardens are often home to a wide variety of plant species, including rare and exotic ones. They are also places where plants are cultivated and cared for, which could be important for a special ficus that requires specific conditions to thrive.Option B, doctor's office, seems unlikely. While some doctors' offices may have plants for decoration or air quality purposes, it's not a typical place to find a special ficus.Option C, in a sea, is clearly incorrect. Ficus plants are terrestrial and cannot survive underwater.Option D, public place, is too broad to be a definitive answer. A special ficus could potentially be found in a public park, plaza, or other outdoor space, but it would depend on the specific location and whether it has a collection of plants.Option E, arboretum, is another good possibility. An arboretum is a place where trees and other woody plants are grown for scientific, educational, and aesthetic purposes. Many arboreta have collections of rare and unusual plants, including ficus species.Therefore, the most likely answer is A. botanical garden or E. arboretum.	0.020689655172413793	0.0	0.0034482758620689655	0.03103448275862069	0.09655172413793103	0.017241379310344827	0.041379310344827586	0.23103448275862068	0.05517241379310345	0.0	0.06551724137931035	0.1310344827586207	0.15172413793103448	0.0	0.010344827586206896	290

267	The question is asking about customers who want things delivered straight to their doorstep for convenience. This means that they do not want to physically go to a store or shop to purchase the item. Option A, mail orders, fits this description as customers can order items through the mail and have them delivered to their doorstep. Option B, demand satisfaction, does not fit the description as it is not related to delivery or convenience. Option C, place money on counter, also does not fit the description as it implies physically going to a store or shop. Option D, pay merchants with money, is a general statement that does not specifically relate to delivery or convenience. Option E, spend money, is also a general statement that does not specifically relate to delivery or convenience.

269	First, we need to determine which side of the plate the spoon should be placed on. In traditional table settings, the spoon is placed on the right side of the plate. Next, we need to consider what the spoon is being used for. If it is being used for soup, it should be placed in the bowl of soup. If it is being used for a main course, it should be placed on the right side of the plate, with the handle facing to the right. If the spoon is a serving spoon, it should be placed in the serving dish.

278	First, copying is not a helpful approach to learning hard concepts as it does not involve understanding or critical thinking. Second, intelligence can certainly be helpful, but it is not the only factor in learning difficult concepts. Third, improved performance can be a result of learning hard concepts, but it is not a requirement to start with. Fourth, empowerment can be a helpful mindset to have when approaching difficult concepts, but it is not a requirement. Finally, having more knowledge can certainly be helpful, but it is not the only factor in learning hard concepts. Therefore, the best answer is B. intelligent, but it is important to note that intelligence alone is not enough and other factors such as effort, persistence, and effective learning strategies are also important.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.04081632653061224	0.1292517006802721	0.013605442176870748	0.061224489795918366	0.17687074829931973	0.047619047619047616	0.0	0.061224489795918366	0.1564625850340136	0.1292517006802721	0.0	0.034013605442176874	147
279	First, we need to understand why addicts turn to exercise. It is because exercise can help them deal with their addictions in a healthy way. Next, we need to consider what exercise can do for the body. It can condition the heart, expend energy, stretch muscles, and help with weight management. Out of these options, the most likely answer is B. Exercise can help addicts expend energy in a healthy way, which can be a positive outlet for their addictive tendencies. While the other options may also be benefits of exercise, they are not directly related to why addicts turn to exercise as a coping mechanism.	0.008333333333333333	0.0	0.016666666666666666	0.075	0.1	0.03333333333333333	0.041666666666666664	0.2	0.09166666666666666	0.0	0.14166666666666666	0.05	0.11666666666666667	0.0	0.008333333333333333	120
280	First, we need to understand what a night owl is. A night owl is someone who stays up late and is active during the night. So, what would you hear at sunset? Nothing specific related to night owls. Now, let's move on to the second part of the question. What would you hear at sunrise? This is a clue that we need to think about something related to morning or early morning. Option A, morning person, is a general term for someone who is active and alert in the morning, but it doesn't necessarily relate to what you would hear at sunrise. Option B, early bird, is a term that means someone who wakes up early, but again, it doesn't relate to what you would hear at sunrise. Option C, lark, is a term that refers to a type of bird that is known for singing in the morning. This is a strong contender for the answer. Option D, early riser, is similar to early bird and doesn't relate to what you would hear at sunrise. Option E, rooster, is another strong contender for the answer. Roosters are known for crowing at sunrise, so this is the most likely answer. Therefore, the answer is E. rooster.	0.01646090534979424	0.0	0.00823045267489712	0.11522633744855967	0.09465020576131687	0.00411522633744856	0.037037037037037035	0.18106995884773663	0.11522633744855967	0.0	0.09876543209876543	0.05761316872427984	0.13580246913580246	0.0	0.03292181069958848	243

So, we can eliminate options A, B, D, and E as they are not related to bagels.That leaves us with option C, plain. It is possible that rich people may prefer plain bagels as they are a classic and simple option. However, it is important to note that preferences for bagels can vary greatly among individuals regardless of their wealth status.	0.01098901098901099	0.0	0.03296703296703297	0.0989010989010989	0.08791208791208792	0.03296703296703297	0.054945054945054944	0.18681318681318682	0.10989010989010989	0.0	0.0989010989010989	0.08791208791208792	0.13186813186813187	0.0	0.01098901098901099	91

284	"First, we need to understand what a small knight is. It could refer to a young knight or a miniature knight. If it is a young knight, then option C (middle ages) and option B (castle) are likely places to find them. Knights were warriors who served their lords during the middle ages, and castles were their primary residence. If it is a miniature knight, then option D (chess board) and option E (doll house) are likely places to find them. Miniature knights are often used as game pieces in chess or as toys in dollhouses. Option A (fairy tale) could also be a possibility as knights are often featured in fairy tales. Therefore, the answer could be any of the options depending on the context and interpretation of the term ""small knight."""	0.03164556962025317	0.0	0.006329113924050633	0.06329113924050633	0.08860759493670886	0.012658227848101266	0.04430379746835443	0.26582278481012656	0.06962025316455696	0.0	0.056962025316455694	0.0759493670886076	0.15822784810126583	0.0	0.0189873417721519	158

287	The cabinets were imported from the south, but we don't know which country or region specifically. John bought them because he knew they would look good, but we don't know what his plans were for them. However, we can make an educated guess based on the common uses of cabinets. Option A, kitchen, is the most likely answer. Cabinets are commonly used in kitchens to store dishes, utensils, and food items. Since John bought the cabinets because he knew they would look good, it's possible that he was planning a kitchen renovation or upgrade. Option B, pantry, is also a possibility. A pantry is a room or closet used for storing food and kitchen supplies. Cabinets could be installed in a pantry to provide additional storage space. Option C, containing pots and pans, is similar to option A. Pots and pans are commonly stored in kitchen cabinets, so this option is also likely referring to a kitchen installation. Option D, in a flight, doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence. It's possible that this is a typo or mistake. Option E, Mexico, is also unlikely. The sentence doesn't provide any indication that the cabinets were intended for installation in Mexico. Therefore, the most likely answer is A. kitchen.	0.0642570281124498	0.0	0.012048192771084338	0.05622489959839357	0.10040160642570281	0.028112449799196786	0.04417670682730924	0.24497991967871485	0.060240963855421686	0.0	0.10040160642570281	0.040160642570281124	0.13253012048192772	0.0	0.020080321285140562	249

290	Bob and Boris were standing in a queue at the grocery store. They were standing in place, which means they were not moving forward in the line. The line was fast, which means it was moving quickly. However, the children in front of them were loud, which means they were making noise. Based on this information, the best answer would be D. irritation. The noise from the children was likely bothering Bob and Boris, causing them to feel irritated. While options A, B, and C could also be possible, they do not specifically address the cause of Bob and Boris's discomfort, which is the loud children.

291	First, we know that a blowfish lives free and on his own. This means that he is not kept in captivity or as a pet. Next, we can eliminate options A and B, as a fish market and pet shop are both places where fish are kept in captivity. Option D, a river, is a possible location for a blowfish to live, but it is not specific enough. Blowfish can be found in various bodies of water, including oceans, seas, and rivers. Option E, the Little Mermaid, is a fictional character and not a real location. Therefore, the correct answer is C, the great outdoors.

It would likely be left in a visible location where the homeowner or resident would see it. Based on these considerations, the most likely answer is A. front door. This is a common location for paper notices to be left, such as for package deliveries, neighborhood announcements, or maintenance work. B. conference, C. classroom, and E. suitcase are unlikely locations for a paper notice to be left on a house.

293	The question states that people are purposefully harming others. This means that they are intentionally causing harm to others. Option A, deceptive, means that they are being dishonest or misleading. This may or may not be true in this scenario, as they may be upfront about their intentions to harm others. Option B, altruistic, means that they are selflessly helping others. This is the opposite of what is happening in this scenario. Option C, stupid, is not a trait that describes intentional harm towards others. Option D, cruel, is a trait that fits the scenario. Cruelty involves causing pain or suffering to others, which is what is happening in this scenario. Option E, aggressive, may also fit the scenario as aggression can involve intentionally causing harm to others. Therefore, the correct answer is either D. cruel or E. aggressive.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.05521472392638037	0.1165644171779141	0.024539877300613498	0.03680981595092025	0.19631901840490798	0.06748466257668712	0.0	0.09815950920245399	0.07975460122699386	0.147239263803681	0.0	0.006134969325153374	163
294	First, we know that the man ate uncooked chicken for dinner. This is a problem because uncooked chicken can contain harmful bacteria like salmonella. Next, we need to consider what might happen to the man as a result of eating the uncooked chicken. Option A, indigestion, is a possibility. Eating undercooked meat can cause discomfort and digestive issues. Option B, died, is extreme but technically possible if the chicken was contaminated with a particularly dangerous strain of bacteria. Option C, illness, is a likely outcome. The man may experience symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. Option D, feel better, is unlikely. Eating uncooked chicken is not a healthy choice and is likely to cause negative consequences. Option E, throwing up, is also a possibility. If the man's body detects harmful bacteria in the chicken, it may try to expel it through vomiting.

Option B, ""thank god,"" doesn't seem as likely. While some people may feel grateful for the opportunity to be at the beach, it's not a common reason for someone to lay down on the sand. Option C, ""race against time,"" doesn't make sense in this context. There's no indication that the person is in a hurry or trying to accomplish something quickly. Option D, ""express love,"" also doesn't seem like a likely reason for someone to lay on the beach. While the beach can be a romantic setting, it's not clear from the question that the person is with a partner or expressing love in any way. Option E, ""to think about things,"" is a possibility.

Birth - This is a possible answer because birth is the end result of the reproductive process, where a new life is brought into the world.C. Presents - This is not the answer because presents have nothing to do with the reproductive process.D.

Next, we need to consider the demand for sporting goods. If there are many sports teams, leagues, and events in the area, there will likely be a high demand for sporting goods. Based on these factors, the answer would be B. city. A large city with a strong sports culture could easily have hundreds of sporting goods stores to meet the demand of its residents.	0.009433962264150943	0.0	0.018867924528301886	0.04716981132075472	0.10377358490566038	0.018867924528301886	0.03773584905660377	0.29245283018867924	0.08490566037735849	0.0	0.0660377358490566	0.05660377358490566	0.11320754716981132	0.0	0.02830188679245283	106
303	The little girl was raised selfish, which means she only thinks about herself and her own needs. The question then asks what she didn't even care about. A. Crack - This answer choice doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence. B. Antipathy - Antipathy means a strong feeling of dislike or hostility towards someone or something. While this could be a possible answer, it doesn't fit well with the rest of the sentence. C. Being mean - This answer choice makes sense in the context of the sentence. If the little girl was raised selfish, she may not care about being mean to others. D. Disinterest - Disinterest means a lack of interest or concern. This could be a possible answer, but it doesn't fit as well as answer choice C. E. Unfeeling - Unfeeling means lacking emotion or compassion. This could also be a possible answer, but it doesn't fit as well as answer choice C. Therefore, the best answer is C. being mean.	0.026595744680851064	0.0	0.0	0.05851063829787234	0.09574468085106383	0.010638297872340425	0.047872340425531915	0.18617021276595744	0.0797872340425532	0.0	0.09042553191489362	0.06382978723404255	0.11170212765957446	0.0	0.02127659574468085	188
304	First, we need to consider the environment of space - it is a vacuum with no air, gravity, or atmosphere. Therefore, options A, B, D, and E are not suitable for space exploration. The most practical option for space exploration is a space shuttle, which is specifically designed for space travel and can carry astronauts and equipment into space.

306	First, we need to consider the purpose of the light. Is it for illumination, decoration, or something else? Assuming it's for illumination, we can eliminate options A, C, and E as they are not practical locations for a light. Option D, the attic, could be a good location for a light if it is a space that needs to be well-lit for storage or other purposes. Option B, the desk, is a common location for a light as it provides direct illumination for reading, writing, or working.

Gain weight: This can happen regardless of who made the hamburger, as it depends on the calorie content and your overall diet and exercise habits.C. Have fun: This is not related to the hamburger itself, but rather the social situation in which it is consumed.D. Heartburn: This can happen regardless of who made the hamburger, as it depends on the individual's digestive system and any underlying conditions.E. Food poisoning: This is the most likely answer, as eating food prepared by someone you do not know increases the risk of contamination or improper handling of ingredients.

309	First, we know that the person is standing in a landlocked state, which means they are not near any coastlines. Next, we know that they are in a southern state, which narrows down the options to states in the southern region of the United States. Finally, we know that they have seen a fox, which could potentially be found in many different states. Based on these clues, the most likely answer is E. Arkansas, as it is a landlocked state in the southern region of the United States and is known to have a population of foxes. The other options are less likely, as they either do not fit the criteria of being landlocked or are not known for having a significant fox population.	0.043478260869565216	0.0	0.021739130434782608	0.057971014492753624	0.10144927536231885	0.021739130434782608	0.043478260869565216	0.13768115942028986	0.11594202898550725	0.0	0.10144927536231885	0.07971014492753623	0.10144927536231885	0.0	0.028985507246376812	138
310	The question states that when the person got out of the car in the mountains, they felt like they were breathing fresh air for the first time. This suggests that the air quality was significantly better than what they were used to. To enjoy this fresh air more, the person would likely want to do something that involves breathing in deeply. This rules out options A and B, as they are too general and do not specifically relate to breathing. Option C, hyperventilating, involves breathing too quickly and can lead to dizziness and fainting. This is not a desirable way to enjoy fresh air. Option D, looking around, is not necessarily related to breathing and does not directly enhance the experience of fresh air. Therefore, the best answer is E, breathe deeply. This would allow the person to fully take in the fresh air and appreciate the difference from their usual environment.	0.041176470588235294	0.0	0.0	0.047058823529411764	0.07647058823529412	0.01764705882352941	0.08235294117647059	0.16470588235294117	0.08823529411764706	0.0	0.12941176470588237	0.07058823529411765	0.10588235294117647	0.0	0.0058823529411764705	170
311	First, we know that there was a storm. Then, we know that the cow would come outside even after the storm had passed. Finally, we know that the cow wouldn't leave something. Option A, meat grinder, doesn't make sense because cows wouldn't voluntarily go near a meat grinder. Option B, stable, is a possibility, but it doesn't explain why the cow wouldn't leave. Option C, red barn, is also a possibility, but again, it doesn't explain why the cow wouldn't leave. Option D, gate, could be a reason why the cow wouldn't leave, but it doesn't explain why the cow would come outside in the first place. Option E, green field, seems like the most likely answer. The cow would come outside to graze in the green field, even after the storm had passed, and wouldn't leave the field. Therefore, the answer is E. green field.	0.026881720430107527	0.0	0.016129032258064516	0.043010752688172046	0.11290322580645161	0.043010752688172046	0.06989247311827956	0.17204301075268819	0.03225806451612903	0.0	0.10752688172043011	0.03225806451612903	0.16129032258064516	0.0	0.010752688172043012	186
312	First, it's important to know what type of contraceptive you need. If you are unsure, you can speak with a healthcare provider to determine the best option for you. Once you know what type of contraceptive you need, the most common places to obtain them are at a health center or pharmacy. Some types of contraceptives may require a prescription from a healthcare provider, while others can be purchased over-the-counter. It is not recommended to rely on finding a contraceptive in a drawer or medicine cabinet, as the effectiveness and safety of the product may be unknown. Additionally, the emergency room is not typically a place to obtain contraceptives, as they are not typically stocked in this setting.	0.022058823529411766	0.0	0.0	0.07352941176470588	0.08823529411764706	0.022058823529411766	0.03676470588235294	0.22058823529411764	0.10294117647058823	0.0	0.10294117647058823	0.03676470588235294	0.11029411764705882	0.0	0.007352941176470588	136

314	First, we need to understand what a ficus plant is. A ficus plant is a type of indoor plant that is known for its lush green leaves and ability to thrive in low light conditions. Next, we need to consider where a ficus plant would be most appropriate. Option A, the Middle East, is not specific enough to determine if a ficus plant would be appropriate there. Option B, a palace, could be a good option as ficus plants are often used in interior design to add a touch of nature and elegance to a space. Option C, a dictionary, is not relevant to the question. Option D, pots, is also not relevant as it does not specify where the pots would be located. Therefore, the best answer is option E, an apartment. A ficus plant would be a great addition to an apartment as it can add a pop of color and life to a space, especially in areas with limited natural light.	0.016129032258064516	0.0	0.010752688172043012	0.03763440860215054	0.10752688172043011	0.016129032258064516	0.04838709677419355	0.23655913978494625	0.08064516129032258	0.0	0.06451612903225806	0.08602150537634409	0.11827956989247312	0.0	0.010752688172043012	186
315	The turkey needs to be kept from spoiling, which means it needs to be stored in a cool environment. Option D, the oven, is not a suitable option as it is used for cooking, not storing food. Option E, bought at store, is not a solution as it does not address the issue of storage. Option A, refrigerator, and option B, fridge, are essentially the same thing and are both suitable options for storing the turkey. Option C, freezer, is also a suitable option, but it would require thawing the turkey before cooking. Therefore, the most useful option in this situation would be A or B, the refrigerator/fridge.	0.030534351145038167	0.0	0.0	0.030534351145038167	0.0916030534351145	0.0	0.030534351145038167	0.22900763358778625	0.07633587786259542	0.0	0.10687022900763359	0.04580152671755725	0.16030534351145037	0.0	0.0	131
316	"First, we know that Sam found a ""giant"" hole, which suggests that it is likely to be a large and deep hole. Option A, hill, does not fit this description as hills are typically elevated areas of land, not holes. Option B, gorge, is a possibility as it refers to a narrow and steep-sided valley, often with a stream or river running through it. However, a gorge is usually formed by erosion from water, whereas the cause of the hole in the plain is not specified. Option C, sandplain, is also unlikely as it refers to a flat, sandy area, not a hole. Option D, cliff, is also unlikely as cliffs are typically steep, vertical rock faces, not holes. Option E, mountain, is also unlikely as mountains are large, elevated landforms, not holes. Therefore, the best answer is B, gorge, as it is the closest option that fits the description of a large and deep hole in the plain."	0.02040816326530612	0.0	0.00510204081632653	0.03571428571428571	0.07142857142857142	0.015306122448979591	0.05102040816326531	0.20918367346938777	0.08673469387755102	0.0	0.061224489795918366	0.10204081632653061	0.1836734693877551	0.0	0.015306122448979591	196
317	First, we need to identify where oxygen is present. Oxygen is present in the air we breathe, so option A is a possibility. However, oxygen is also present in water, so option B cannot be ruled out completely. Option C, earth, is too broad and does not provide enough information to determine if oxygen needs to be tracked. Option D, space shuttle, is a possibility as oxygen is necessary for astronauts to breathe in space. Option E, tunnel, does not provide enough information to determine if oxygen needs to be tracked.

319	"The person knew the police were after him. This means that he was aware that law enforcement officials were looking for him. So, what would be a logical response to this situation? Option A, ""the sun,"" doesn't make sense in this context. It's not a relevant action or response to being pursued by the police. Option B, ""catch cold,"" is also not a logical response. Getting sick wouldn't help the person evade the police or deal with the situation at hand. Option C, ""prepare to go,"" seems like a more reasonable response. If the person knows that the police are after him, he might want to prepare to leave his current location or hide somewhere else. Option D, ""feel humiliated,"" is an emotional response that doesn't necessarily lead to any action. While the person might feel embarrassed or ashamed about being pursued by the police, this doesn't tell us what he actually did in response.

321	The question is asking about a situation where someone is fiddling through a music book instead of playing. This suggests that the person is not actively engaged in playing music at that moment. Option A, practice, could be a possible answer if the person simply needs more practice to be able to play without looking at the music book. However, the question implies that the person is not even attempting to play at that moment, so this answer is not the best choice. Option B, dexterity, refers to physical skill and coordination, which could be important for playing an instrument. However, the question does not suggest that the person is struggling with physical limitations, so this answer is also not the best choice. Option C, idle time, suggests that the person may be bored or lacking in motivation to play. This could be a possible answer, but it does not fully capture the situation described in the question. Option D, knowledge of music, is a strong possibility. If the person is fiddling through a music book instead of playing, it could be because they are not confident in their ability to play the music without looking at the notes. This could be due to a lack of knowledge or familiarity with the music. Option E, conductor, is not relevant to the question, as it does not address the situation of someone fiddling through a music book instead of playing.

Alternatively, you could also check with a music rental company or online retailer. So the answer would be C. music store or B. school band (for rental).	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.09183673469387756	0.08163265306122448	0.04081632653061224	0.07142857142857142	0.19387755102040816	0.04081632653061224	0.02040816326530612	0.1326530612244898	0.030612244897959183	0.11224489795918367	0.0	0.030612244897959183	98
324	First, you need to understand what artifacts are and what they represent. This requires learning about their historical, cultural, and social significance. Next, you need to consider your own emotional and mental state. If seeing artifacts triggers painful memories or emotions, it may not be a good idea to view them. On the other hand, if seeing artifacts inspires awe and pleasure, it may be a positive experience. Finally, you need to weigh the pros and cons of seeing artifacts. Is it worth the time, effort, and potential emotional impact? Will it enrich your understanding and appreciation of history and culture? Therefore, the answer is A. learning, C. thinking, and considering your emotional and mental state.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.10869565217391304	0.057971014492753624	0.014492753623188406	0.028985507246376812	0.18840579710144928	0.028985507246376812	0.0	0.13043478260869565	0.10869565217391304	0.15942028985507245	0.0	0.014492753623188406	138

326	"The launch pad is just one part of a larger complex. This complex is described as ""vast,"" which suggests that it is quite large. The launch pad is also mentioned in the context of space travel, which narrows down our options. A. Movie: This option doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence. There is no indication that the complex is related to movies. B. Cape Kennedy: This option is a possibility, as Cape Kennedy (also known as Cape Canaveral) is a well-known location for space launches. However, the sentence doesn't explicitly mention Cape Kennedy, so we can't be sure. C. Space center: This option seems likely, as a space center would be a logical place for a launch pad to be located. D. Military installation: This option doesn't seem likely, as the sentence doesn't mention anything about the complex being related to the military. E. Spaceship center: This option is similar to option C, but uses a different term.

327	First, we need to consider the fact that the electronics were damaged by rain. Therefore, we need to store them in a place that is dry and protected from the elements. Option A, a large city, does not provide any specific location for storage and may not necessarily be a dry and protected environment. Option B, a strip mall, may have some covered areas, but it is not a guaranteed dry and protected environment. Option D, a shopping mall, may have some indoor areas that are dry and protected, but it may not be the best option for storing electronics. Option E, an aquarium, is not a suitable option for storing electronics as it is not designed for that purpose. Therefore, the best option for storing electronics damaged by rain would be option C, a building.

328	First, we know that the man was lonely. Loneliness can lead to feelings of isolation, sadness, and despair. This could contribute to his decision to end his life.Second, we know that he committed suicide. Suicide is often seen as a way to escape pain or suffering. It is possible that the man was experiencing emotional or physical pain that he felt he could not bear any longer.Third, we can eliminate options B and C as they do not align with the fact that the man committed suicide. Option D, unhappy, is a possibility given his loneliness and potential pain. However, option A, suffering, and option E, end pain, seem to be the most likely reasons for his decision to take his own life.Therefore, the answer is either A or E, or both.	0.0440251572327044	0.0	0.018867924528301886	0.0880503144654088	0.07547169811320754	0.025157232704402517	0.05660377358490566	0.22641509433962265	0.0440251572327044	0.0	0.1069182389937107	0.050314465408805034	0.1509433962264151	0.0	0.025157232704402517	159

334	First, we know that the memory is of a small child calling a giraffe mascot a cow. This suggests that the child was not yet familiar with different types of animals. Next, we know that the memory is of something that is now defunct. This means that whatever it was, it no longer exists. Based on these clues, the most likely answer is A. toy store. It's common for toy stores to have mascots or characters that children can interact with, and it's possible that the child in question encountered a giraffe mascot at a toy store.

335	The sentence mentions that the person had a hard time finding a room on his schedule. This implies that he was in a place where there are multiple rooms. The sentence also mentions that the room was on the second floor. This narrows down the options to places that have multiple floors. Option A: School - Schools usually have multiple floors and rooms, so this could be a possibility. Option B: Office building - Office buildings also have multiple floors and rooms, so this could be a possibility as well. Option C: House - Houses usually do not have multiple floors and rooms, so this is unlikely. Option D: Hotel - Hotels have multiple floors and rooms, so this could be a possibility. Option E: Centre - This is a vague option as it could refer to many different types of centers (e.g. community center, shopping center, etc.).

339	First, we need to understand what an organization is. An organization is a group of people who work together to achieve a common goal or purpose. Now, if a new organization is being formed, the goal of telling many people about it is likely to be to accomplish something. This could be to gain support for the organization, recruit new members, raise awareness about the organization's mission or cause, or attract funding or resources. While money or notoriety may be a byproduct of successfully promoting the organization, they are not likely to be the primary goal. Similarly, religion may be the purpose of some organizations, but it is not a universal goal for all new organizations.

345	Farmers typically do not keep toothpicks in their mouth as they are not a common item for them to use. Toothpicks are also not typically found in a grocery store, as they are a small item that may not be sold in bulk. While farmers may use toothpicks for constructing models, this is not a common practice. A shed may be a possible location for farmers to store tools and equipment, but toothpicks are not typically considered tools. Therefore, the most likely answer is E. box, as farmers may keep toothpicks in a small container or box for personal use or to offer to guests.	0.02608695652173913	0.0	0.0	0.043478260869565216	0.11304347826086956	0.008695652173913044	0.05217391304347826	0.23478260869565218	0.10434782608695652	0.0	0.08695652173913043	0.06086956521739131	0.08695652173913043	0.0	0.0	115
346	"The detective had to analyze all the clues, which means he had to carefully examine and study them. This eliminates options B, C, and E. Next, the question states that he had to analyze ""every little thing"" at the scene. This suggests that he had to pay close attention to details, which supports option A, ""look at."" Finally, the question asks what he had to do with the clues. The word ""analyse"" implies that he had to use his brain to make sense of the clues, which supports option D, ""think about."" Therefore, the correct answer is A and D: the detective had to look at all the clues and think about them carefully."	0.050359712230215826	0.0	0.0	0.06474820143884892	0.06474820143884892	0.02158273381294964	0.02877697841726619	0.18705035971223022	0.05755395683453238	0.0	0.12949640287769784	0.02158273381294964	0.17985611510791366	0.0	0.007194244604316547	139
347	First, we need to understand that skin color is determined by genetics. So, a person with brown skin may share that skin color with their biological family members, such as parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. They may also share it with people from the same ethnic or racial group, as certain groups tend to have a higher prevalence of brown skin. Therefore, the correct answer is C. own family.	0.011764705882352941	0.0	0.011764705882352941	0.047058823529411764	0.058823529411764705	0.011764705882352941	0.047058823529411764	0.25882352941176473	0.09411764705882353	0.0	0.07058823529411765	0.12941176470588237	0.16470588235294117	0.0	0.023529411764705882	85
348	A chain ring is a circular metal component with teeth that is used in bicycles to transfer power from the pedals to the rear wheel. It is screwed onto the crank arm of the bike.

349	First, you would need to have the dictionary with you. So, you would likely pick it up from a shelf or a table. Then, while you're using it, you would want it to be easily accessible and within reach. Therefore, options A, D, and E are not the best choices as they suggest a location where you may not have direct access to the dictionary. That leaves us with options B and C. Both are good choices, but it ultimately depends on your personal preference and the setup of your study area. If you have a desk or table where you're working, placing the dictionary on the table would be convenient. If you're sitting in a comfortable chair or on a couch, you may prefer to have the dictionary nearby on a nearby shelf or table. So, the answer is either B or C, depending on your specific situation.	0.0	0.0	0.005813953488372093	0.11046511627906977	0.10465116279069768	0.029069767441860465	0.05232558139534884	0.16279069767441862	0.08139534883720931	0.0	0.06976744186046512	0.05813953488372093	0.11627906976744186	0.0	0.005813953488372093	172
350	First, we need to understand what it means to be awake. Being awake means that a person is not sleeping and is aware of their surroundings. Option A, alert, means that a person is paying attention and is ready to respond to any situation. This is a characteristic of someone who is awake, so it could be the correct answer. Option B, deep sleep, is the opposite of being awake. If someone is in deep sleep, they are not aware of their surroundings and cannot know what's going on. Option C, drink coffee, is not necessarily a characteristic of someone who is awake. While caffeine can help people stay alert, it doesn't necessarily mean they are awake. Option D, open eyes, is a physical characteristic of someone who is awake, but it doesn't necessarily mean they are aware of their surroundings. Option E, conscious, means that a person is aware of their surroundings and can respond to stimuli. This is a characteristic of someone who is awake, so it could also be the correct answer. Based on these explanations, the most likely correct answers are A, alert, and E, conscious.	0.004424778761061947	0.0	0.004424778761061947	0.10619469026548672	0.1415929203539823	0.030973451327433628	0.030973451327433628	0.1504424778761062	0.061946902654867256	0.0	0.07079646017699115	0.10176991150442478	0.1415929203539823	0.0	0.004424778761061947	226
351	First, you would need to have swords in your house to find them. Assuming you do have swords in your house, here are the possible locations:A. Sheath - A sheath is a protective covering for a sword, typically made of leather or other materials. If you have swords with sheaths, you may find them in a designated area where you keep your weapons.B. Sword closet - If you have a collection of swords, you may have a designated closet or storage area where you keep them. This could be a locked cabinet or a display case.C. Collection - If you collect swords, you may have them displayed on a wall or in a special room in your house. You may also have them stored in a safe or other secure location.D. Scabbard - A scabbard is another term for a sheath, so this option is similar to option A.E. Museum - If you have a large collection of swords or rare and valuable swords, you may have them displayed in a private museum in your house.So, the answer is any of the above options depending on the individual's situation.	0.028037383177570093	0.0	0.0	0.11214953271028037	0.10747663551401869	0.028037383177570093	0.02336448598130841	0.205607476635514	0.0794392523364486	0.0	0.06542056074766354	0.06542056074766354	0.11214953271028037	0.0	0.028037383177570093	214
352	The question states that Bill did not abandon the fight, which means he continued to fight. Therefore, options A, C, and D (arrogate, embrace, and smile) are unlikely to be the correct answer. Option B, retain, could be a possibility, as it means to keep or hold onto something. However, it doesn't necessarily imply any action towards the enemy. Option E, engage, is the most likely answer, as it means to actively participate or become involved in something, which fits with the context of the question. Therefore, the answer is E.	0.017543859649122806	0.0	0.0	0.05263157894736842	0.07017543859649122	0.008771929824561403	0.05263157894736842	0.15789473684210525	0.06140350877192982	0.0	0.10526315789473684	0.03508771929824561	0.19298245614035087	0.0	0.008771929824561403	114
353	First, we need to understand what an amenity is. An amenity is a feature or service that adds value or convenience to a place or experience. Next, we need to consider what a shower is. A shower is a device that sprays water onto a person's body for the purpose of cleaning. Now, we can eliminate options A, C, and E because they do not typically offer accommodations where a shower would be expected. That leaves us with options B and D. While a bathroom may have a shower, it is not necessarily expected. However, when you reserve a motel room, a shower is an expected amenity. Therefore, the correct answer is B. motel room.	0.015037593984962405	0.0	0.03007518796992481	0.08270676691729323	0.09774436090225563	0.03007518796992481	0.05263157894736842	0.22556390977443608	0.03759398496240601	0.0	0.09022556390977443	0.015037593984962405	0.12781954887218044	0.0	0.022556390977443608	133

356	"First, we need to identify the keyword in the question, which is ""liquid."" This tells us that we are looking for a place where there is a liquid present. Next, we need to consider the context of the question, which is ""in a workplace."" This narrows down our options to places where people gather in a work setting. A. Water cooler - This is a common gathering spot in many workplaces where people go to get a drink of water or chat with colleagues. It is likely that there is a liquid present (water) at the water cooler, so this could be a possible answer. B. Opera - While there may be liquids present at an opera (such as drinks or water bottles), this is not typically a workplace setting where people gather. C. Hospital - While there are liquids present in a hospital (such as IV fluids or cleaning solutions), this is not necessarily a place where people gather near liquid. D. Hockey game - While there may be liquids present at a hockey game (such as drinks or ice), this is not a workplace setting where people gather. E. Beach - While there is certainly liquid present at a beach (the ocean), this is not a workplace setting where people gather. Therefore, the most likely answer is A. water cooler."	0.0	0.0	0.019455252918287938	0.04669260700389105	0.07782101167315175	0.054474708171206226	0.027237354085603113	0.2178988326848249	0.07392996108949416	0.0	0.07003891050583658	0.06614785992217899	0.1556420233463035	0.0	0.023346303501945526	257
357	First, you need to set up your tent somewhere. Option A is not a place to store your tent, it's a place to sleep in. Option B is a possible location to set up your tent, but it doesn't answer the question of where to store it. Option C is also a possible location to set up your tent, but again, it doesn't answer the question of where to store it. Option D is a possible way to store your tent, but it doesn't allow you to keep it on your person. Option E is the correct answer because you can store your tent in your backpack and keep it on your person while hiking or traveling.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.15037593984962405	0.07518796992481203	0.03007518796992481	0.03007518796992481	0.17293233082706766	0.06766917293233082	0.0	0.12781954887218044	0.03007518796992481	0.09022556390977443	0.0	0.007518796992481203	133
358	When people play games, they engage in an activity that is meant to be entertaining and enjoyable. This can lead to feelings of happiness and relaxation as they focus on the game and forget about other stresses in their life. Winning can also be a result of playing games, but it is not always the main goal. Cheating, on the other hand, is not a positive outcome of playing games and can lead to negative consequences.

362	If the ground is getting wet, it means that there is moisture or water present. This could be due to rain, snow, or a nearby body of water such as a river or lake. It is unlikely that the ground is solidifying or melting, as these processes involve changes in temperature and the presence of certain substances. The ground may be getting cold if it is exposed to cold air or if the water on the surface is evaporating, but this would not necessarily cause it to become wet. Feeling cold or having a skin rash are not related to the wetness of the ground. Therefore, the most likely answer is that it is raining or there has been recent precipitation in the area.	0.022058823529411766	0.0	0.0	0.051470588235294115	0.11764705882352941	0.04411764705882353	0.022058823529411766	0.20588235294117646	0.08088235294117647	0.0	0.09558823529411764	0.08823529411764706	0.08823529411764706	0.0	0.0	136
363	First, we need to consider where magazines are commonly found. Magazines are typically sold in bookstores and can also be borrowed from libraries. However, the question is asking where most people keep magazines, not where they are sold or borrowed from. Next, we can eliminate options A and B since they refer to places where magazines are sold or borrowed from, not where people keep them. Option C, doctor, is a possibility since many doctors' offices have magazines available for patients to read while they wait. However, this is not where most people keep magazines. That leaves us with options D and E. Since magazines are often purchased for personal reading or subscriptions, it is likely that most people keep magazines at home. Option D is the correct answer.

364	The question mentions a joke about eating small dogs. This suggests that the cuisine in question is known for consuming dogs as food. Option A, backpack, does not make sense in this context. Option B, dog show, is also unlikely as dog shows are events where dogs are showcased and judged, not eaten. Option D, French cuisine, is known for its culinary excellence and is unlikely to be associated with eating dogs. Option E, good hands, does not make sense in this context. This leaves us with option C, Chinese food. While it is not true that all Chinese cuisine involves eating dogs, there is a stereotype that some Chinese dishes include dog meat.

366	"First, we know that a water spout was seen. This is a weather phenomenon that occurs over bodies of water, usually in the form of a tornado-like column of water and mist. Next, we are given a list of options for where this water spout was seen. Option A is ""Florida."" Florida is a state in the United States that is known for its beaches and oceanfront areas. It is possible that a water spout could be seen off the coast of Florida. Option B is ""basement."" This is unlikely, as water spouts do not typically occur indoors or underground. Option C is ""sink."" Again, this is unlikely as sinks are typically found indoors and are not large enough to support a water spout. Option D is ""beach."" This is a more likely option, as beaches are often located near bodies of water and could potentially be the location where a water spout is seen. Option E is ""fountain."" Fountains are typically man-made structures and are not large enough to support a water spout. Based on this analysis, the most likely answer is A. Florida."	0.05429864253393665	0.0	0.00904977375565611	0.027149321266968326	0.12217194570135746	0.01809954751131222	0.06334841628959276	0.2398190045248869	0.07692307692307693	0.0	0.07239819004524888	0.03619909502262444	0.15384615384615385	0.0	0.027149321266968326	221

368	First, we know that the person is having fun. This means that they are likely experiencing positive emotions and enjoying themselves. Option A, being happy, fits with this idea. If someone is having fun, they are likely feeling happy. Option B, glee, is also a good fit. Glee is a synonym for joy or happiness, which is likely what someone is feeling when they are having fun. Option C, smoke, does not fit with the idea of having fun. Smoking is not typically associated with having a good time. Option D, stress relief, could be a reason why someone is having fun, but it is not necessarily a characteristic of having fun. Option E, laughing, is also a good fit. When someone is having fun, they may laugh and enjoy themselves.

370	First, John couldn't get out the door. This suggests that there is some kind of obstruction preventing him from leaving. Option A, fire, is a possibility, but there is no mention of flames or smoke, so we can't be sure. Option C, winter storm, is also a possibility, but again, there is no mention of snow or ice. Option E, burn down, is unlikely since the smoke detectors went off and it was a false alarm. Option B, belong to, doesn't make sense in this context. That leaves us with option D, face south. This seems like an unlikely answer, but it's the only one left. However, it's important to remember that sometimes the correct answer isn't the most obvious one. In this case, we don't have enough information to definitively say why John is stuck, but we can eliminate some possibilities and make an educated guess based on the clues given.	0.0374331550802139	0.0	0.0213903743315508	0.058823529411764705	0.0962566844919786	0.026737967914438502	0.0427807486631016	0.17647058823529413	0.06951871657754011	0.0106951871657754	0.10695187165775401	0.0481283422459893	0.1497326203208556	0.0	0.0213903743315508	187
371	First, we need to understand what the Tardis is. The Tardis is a time and space machine used by the Doctor in the TV show Doctor Who. It is a blue police box on the outside, but on the inside, it is much larger and contains various rooms and corridors.Next, we need to understand what the master control is. The master control is the central console that the Doctor uses to operate the Tardis. It controls the time and space travel functions of the Tardis.Now, we can eliminate options A, C, D, and E as they do not make sense for the location of the master control. The nuclear power plant, basement, main office, and bowel of the ship are not logical places for the master control.Therefore, the answer is B, center. The master control is located in the center of the main room of the Tardis.	0.011560693641618497	0.0	0.017341040462427744	0.06358381502890173	0.06358381502890173	0.0	0.028901734104046242	0.24277456647398843	0.07514450867052024	0.0	0.06936416184971098	0.046242774566473986	0.1329479768786127	0.0	0.03468208092485549	173

373	First, we need to identify what kind of shopping bag we are looking for. Based on the context of the question, we can assume that it is a reusable bag for packing groceries. Option A, supermarket, is a possible answer as many supermarkets offer reusable shopping bags for purchase. Option B, home, is not a likely answer as the question is asking where to find a shopping bag, not where to store one. Option C, closet, is also not a likely answer as it assumes that the person already has a shopping bag in their possession. Option D, mart, is a vague answer as it could refer to a variety of stores, but it is possible that a mart such as Walmart or Target would sell reusable shopping bags. Option E, hardware store, is not a likely answer as hardware stores typically sell tools and building materials, not shopping bags. Therefore, the most likely answer is A, supermarket.	0.00546448087431694	0.0	0.01639344262295082	0.04918032786885246	0.07650273224043716	0.0273224043715847	0.03278688524590164	0.26229508196721313	0.08196721311475409	0.00546448087431694	0.07650273224043716	0.06557377049180328	0.1366120218579235	0.0	0.01639344262295082	183
374	The lady was getting worked up about the article explaining the uptick in accidents in their area. This means that she was concerned or worried about the increase in accidents. But her husband was dismissive of it. This means that he did not take her concerns seriously and did not think that the article was important. He stated that accidents what? This means that he gave a reason or explanation for why he did not think the article was important. The options are: happen to people, hurt people, happen anytime, happen often, and happen anywhere. Out of these options, the most likely answer is A. happen to people. This is because it is a common phrase that accidents happen to people, meaning that they are a natural occurrence that can happen to anyone. The husband's statement implies that he thinks accidents are not something to worry about because they are a normal part of life.	0.07514450867052024	0.0	0.0	0.10404624277456648	0.09248554913294797	0.057803468208092484	0.028901734104046242	0.17341040462427745	0.09248554913294797	0.0	0.14450867052023122	0.04046242774566474	0.09826589595375723	0.0	0.0	173
375	First, we know that there was a show on television about someone who loved flowers. However, the next day, the show was about someone else who also loved flowers. This suggests that the show is not a continuous series following one character, but rather a collection of different stories or episodes featuring different characters. Option B, anthology, fits this description perfectly. An anthology is a collection of literary works or episodes of a television show that are related by theme, genre, or author, but are otherwise independent of each other. Therefore, the correct answer is B. anthology.	0.04424778761061947	0.0	0.008849557522123894	0.061946902654867256	0.061946902654867256	0.017699115044247787	0.07079646017699115	0.23893805309734514	0.07079646017699115	0.008849557522123894	0.07079646017699115	0.07079646017699115	0.1415929203539823	0.0	0.035398230088495575	113

377	Firstly, it is important to note that prostitution is illegal in many places, so finding a professional prostitute may not be easy or safe. However, if we assume that prostitution is legal and regulated in a certain location, then the most likely place to find a professional prostitute would be in a licensed brothel or escort agency. Therefore, the answer would be B. whorehouse. It is important to note that prostitution is a sensitive and controversial topic, and it is not appropriate to make light of or promote illegal activities.	0.02	0.0	0.01	0.04	0.12	0.04	0.05	0.15	0.04	0.0	0.09	0.15	0.1	0.0	0.02	100

Option A, ignoring, could be a possibility, but it doesn't necessarily imply disrespect. Option B, being rude, is a possibility, but it doesn't fully capture the idea that Jill is not respected by others. Option C, disparagement, is a good fit because it means to speak or treat someone in a disrespectful or belittling way. Option D, contumely, is a synonym of disparagement, but it is a less common word and may not be as familiar to some people. Option E, uncertainty, doesn't fit the context of the sentence at all.

409	"First, we need to identify the mode of transportation mentioned in the question, which is ""transportation on rails."" This narrows down our options to A (train station) and E (airport), as these are the only two options that typically have transportation on rails.Next, we need to consider the location where one might wait for this transportation. While both train stations and airports have waiting rooms, the question specifically mentions reading a magazine, which suggests a more casual setting. Therefore, the most likely answer is A, train station, where there may be newsstands or convenience stores selling magazines for passengers to read while waiting for their train to arrive. B (bookstore) and C (newsstand) are less likely options, as they may not be located within the train station itself. D (waiting room) is a possibility, but as mentioned earlier, it may not be as conducive to casual reading as a newsstand or convenience store. E (airport) is also a possibility, but the question specifically mentions transportation on rails, which is not typically found in airports."	0.018957345971563982	0.0	0.014218009478672985	0.04739336492890995	0.07582938388625593	0.018957345971563982	0.061611374407582936	0.23696682464454977	0.08056872037914692	0.004739336492890996	0.09004739336492891	0.02843601895734597	0.17061611374407584	0.0	0.009478672985781991	211

Next, we need to consider where sharks are typically found. While there are many different species of sharks that live in various parts of the world, they are most commonly associated with the ocean. Based on these two pieces of information, we can eliminate options A and D (an aquarium and a pool hall) as unlikely locations for betting with a shark. Option B (the Mediterranean Sea) and option C (the South Pacific) are both possible locations for sharks, but they are not as well-known for their shark populations as other areas.

Farmland: While there may be outdoor areas on farmland, they are typically larger and used for agricultural purposes rather than residential purposes. B. Neighborhood: This is a possibility. In some urban or suburban neighborhoods, houses may be built close together, resulting in smaller yards. C. City: This is also a possibility. In densely populated cities, houses or apartments may have very small or no outdoor areas. D. Property: This is a bit vague, as a property could refer to any type of land or real estate. However, if we assume it refers to residential properties, then the same possibilities as in B and C apply. E.

Now, we need to find a term that means the same thing as instituting civil action. The word ""instituting"" means to establish or start something, so we need to find a synonym for that.

Intimacy: This option is too vague and could apply to a wide range of situations, not necessarily related to celebration. C. Dancing: Dancing is often associated with joy and celebration, so this could be a possibility. D. Happiness: This option is similar to dancing in that it suggests a positive and joyful atmosphere. E.

Option A: The supermarket is a possibility, as they sell a variety of personal care products, including shampoo. Option B: The motel is also a possibility, as they provide shampoo for their guests. Option C: The hotel is similar to the motel, as they also provide shampoo for their guests. Option D: This option doesn't make sense, as the question is asking where they went through a lot of shampoo, not where the shampoo bottles were. Option E: The hair salon is another possibility, as they use a lot of shampoo on their clients. Therefore, the answer could be A, B, C, or E.

433	First, we need to understand what the man needs - balls of cotton. Option A, south, is too broad and doesn't give us any specific location to look for cotton balls. Option B, Georgia, is a state in the southern United States known for its cotton production. However, just because Georgia produces cotton doesn't mean the man can find cotton balls there. Option C, North Carolina, is another state known for its cotton production. Again, just because cotton is produced there doesn't mean the man can find cotton balls there. Option D, pocket, is a possibility if the man already has cotton balls in his pocket. Option E, medicine cabinet, is the most likely answer. Cotton balls are commonly found in medicine cabinets for various uses such as cleaning wounds or removing makeup.

451	First, we can eliminate options D and E as they are not related to the location of Turkey. Next, we know that Turkey is not located in Asia as a whole, as it is a very large continent. Asia Minor is a historical region that includes modern-day Turkey, so option B is partially correct. However, the most accurate answer is A - Turkey is located in the Middle East, as it is a transcontinental country that spans both Europe and Asia, with the majority of its landmass located in Western Asia.	0.038461538461538464	0.0	0.019230769230769232	0.07692307692307693	0.08653846153846154	0.019230769230769232	0.057692307692307696	0.1346153846153846	0.10576923076923077	0.0	0.07692307692307693	0.057692307692307696	0.125	0.0	0.10576923076923077	104
452	First, we need to understand that happiness is a positive emotion that is triggered by various factors. Surprising and unexpected events can also trigger happiness, but what specifically makes people happy in such situations?A. Joke: Jokes can be surprising and unexpected, but not all jokes make people happy. It depends on the type of joke and the individual's sense of humor. So, we can't say that jokes always make people happy when they are surprising and unexpected.B. Humor: Humor is similar to jokes, and it also depends on the individual's sense of humor. However, humor can be more general and not necessarily related to a specific joke. So, humor can make people happy when it is surprising and unexpected, but it's not a guarantee.C. Frightened: Being frightened is not typically associated with happiness. While some people may enjoy being scared in a controlled environment, it's not a universal experience that makes people happy.D. Fight: Fighting is not a positive experience and is unlikely to make people happy, even if it is surprising and unexpected.E. Laughter: Laughter is a physical response to humor or other stimuli that can make people happy. When something surprising and unexpected triggers laughter, it can be a source of happiness.Therefore, the answer is E.

453	First, we need to identify the type of lizard we want to see and its natural habitat. Once we have that information, we can narrow down our options. Assuming we want to see a variety of lizards, we can eliminate Japan and New Hampshire as they are not known for having a diverse range of lizards. Utah and New Mexico have some species of lizards, but they may not be the ones we are looking for. South America, on the other hand, is known for its diverse range of lizards, including iguanas, geckos, and chameleons. While Spanish is the primary language in many South American countries, there are also English-speaking tour guides and resources available. Therefore, the best option would be B.

457	First, we know that Sarah found a second heart in her patient's chest. This is not a normal occurrence in human beings, so we can eliminate option D. Option A, Istanbul, is a city and not relevant to the question, so we can eliminate it as well. Option C, an antique shop, is also not relevant to the question and can be eliminated. Option E, a bedroom, is also not relevant and can be eliminated. This leaves us with option B, animal. Finding a second heart in a patient's chest would suggest that the patient is not a human being, but rather an animal with a unique anatomy. Therefore, the correct answer is B.	0.022388059701492536	0.0	0.029850746268656716	0.04477611940298507	0.09701492537313433	0.029850746268656716	0.05223880597014925	0.1791044776119403	0.05223880597014925	0.0	0.06716417910447761	0.08208955223880597	0.13432835820895522	0.0	0.04477611940298507	134
458	1. They launch a surprise attack.2. This ended the what?Based on the information given, we can assume that the surprise attack had an impact on a certain situation. We need to determine what that situation is. A. Surrender - This option suggests that the surprise attack caused the opposing side to surrender. However, there is no information given to support this assumption. B. Defence - This option suggests that the surprise attack ended the defence of the opposing side. This is a possible answer, as a surprise attack can catch the defending side off guard and weaken their defence. C. Retreat - This option suggests that the surprise attack caused the opposing side to retreat. This is a possible answer, as a surprise attack can create chaos and confusion, leading to a retreat. D. Cease fire - This option suggests that the surprise attack caused both sides to stop fighting. However, there is no information given to support this assumption. E. Defend - This option does not make sense as it is not a situation that can be ended by a surprise attack. Therefore, the most likely answer is either B. Defence or C.

462	The question mentions that the shore was once home to a bustling fishing industry. This means that it was a place where people used to fish for a living. Therefore, options B, C, and D can be eliminated as they do not relate to fishing. Option E, beach, is too general and does not specify anything about the fishing industry. This leaves us with option A, seaside town, which fits the description of a place where people used to live and work as fishermen.

To get rid of a mundane routine, we need something that is different, exciting, and refreshing. Option A, sophisticated, may add some elegance or refinement to a routine, but it may not necessarily break the monotony. Option B, impervious, means unexpected or unpredictable, which could certainly shake up a routine. Option C, arcane, means mysterious or obscure, which may not necessarily add excitement to a routine. Option D, heavenly, may add a sense of bliss or joy, but it may not necessarily change the routine itself.

485	First, we need to consider what kind of animal a ferret is. A ferret is a small, furry mammal that is often kept as a pet. Next, we need to think about where an animal might get lots of attention. A petting zoo is a place where animals are specifically meant to be interacted with and given attention, so option D is a possibility. However, since ferrets are typically kept as pets in people's homes, option C is also a likely answer. Option A (trouser leg) and option E (mother's hair) are unlikely as they are not typical places for a ferret to receive attention. Option B (sick bay) is also unlikely as it implies the ferret is sick or injured, which is not necessarily the case. Therefore, the most likely answer is either D (petting zoo) or C (own home), depending on the context of the question.	0.03389830508474576	0.0	0.011299435028248588	0.03389830508474576	0.0903954802259887	0.022598870056497175	0.062146892655367235	0.24293785310734464	0.06779661016949153	0.0	0.0847457627118644	0.05649717514124294	0.15254237288135594	0.0	0.005649717514124294	177

Similarly, if the reference denies or refuses to provide information, it may be a red flag, but it does not necessarily mean that the attempt to confirm the reference has failed.The answer is D. contradict.

Option A (space shuttle) and option B (Detroit) are not relevant to the question and can be eliminated. Option D (downtown) is also not relevant to the question. The correct answer is option E (elevator), as it is the most accessible way for John to reach the third floor of his apartment building.	0.010869565217391304	0.0	0.0	0.03260869565217391	0.09782608695652174	0.0	0.03260869565217391	0.2391304347826087	0.06521739130434782	0.0	0.043478260869565216	0.06521739130434782	0.1956521739130435	0.0	0.043478260869565216	92
515	The mother finished wrapping the very last gift. What does she do next? She places it somewhere. Where could she place it? A. Department store - This doesn't make sense because the mother is already done wrapping the gift, so why would she go to a department store to place it?B. Fraizer fur - This also doesn't make sense because Fraizer fur is a type of Christmas tree, not a place to put gifts.C. Specialty store - Again, this doesn't make sense because the mother is already done wrapping the gift, so why would she go to a specialty store to place it?D. Christmas tree - This could be a possibility because many people place gifts under the Christmas tree.E. Christmas stocking - This is also a possibility, but typically stockings are hung up and gifts are placed inside them, not under them.Therefore, the most likely answer is D. Christmas tree.	0.029069767441860465	0.0	0.0	0.05813953488372093	0.09883720930232558	0.040697674418604654	0.0755813953488372	0.19186046511627908	0.046511627906976744	0.0	0.11046511627906977	0.029069767441860465	0.11627906976744186	0.0	0.029069767441860465	172
516	First, we know that the wheel was loose. This means that it was not securely attached and could move around. Next, we know that it threatened to fall off. This means that it was in danger of coming completely off the vehicle or object it was attached to. So, what could have caused this situation? Option A, footloose, doesn't make sense in this context. Option B, sailing, also doesn't make sense unless we're talking about a boat with a loose wheel. Option C, fast, could be a possibility. If the vehicle was moving quickly, the force and vibration could have caused the wheel to become loose. Option D, tighten, is the opposite of what was happening. If someone was tightening the wheel, it wouldn't be loose and threatening to fall off. Option E, bind, doesn't really fit either. Binding would mean that the wheel was stuck or unable to move, which doesn't seem to be the case here. Therefore, the answer is C. The wheel was loose and threatened to fall off when they were moving fast.	0.0794392523364486	0.0	0.014018691588785047	0.056074766355140186	0.1308411214953271	0.04205607476635514	0.06542056074766354	0.13551401869158877	0.0514018691588785	0.0	0.14485981308411214	0.028037383177570093	0.14485981308411214	0.0	0.009345794392523364	214
517	If someone is unintentionally hurting someone else, it means that they did not mean to cause harm. However, they are still causing harm, which can lead to feelings of guilt and remorse. Therefore, the most likely answer is B. regret. The other options, such as empowering, glee, and despair, do not fit the situation described.

518	The sentence mentions letters that had been delivered, so we can eliminate options A, D, and E as they do not specifically relate to letters. Option B, newspaper, is also irrelevant to the sentence.

Putting these two pieces of information together, we can assume that Sally is likely a member of some type of organization or group that has a hierarchical structure, where she has reached a senior level.

535	First, we know that the crab was scuttling, which means it was moving quickly by shuffling its legs. However, it was also strained, which suggests that it was having difficulty moving. Next, we need to consider the options provided. A tide pool or tidepools could potentially impede the crab's movement if they were too shallow or had obstacles in the way. However, beach sand or a current would not necessarily impede the crab's movement unless they were particularly difficult to navigate. Finally, we can eliminate option E, a cooking pot, as it is not a natural environment for a crab to be in and would not impede its movement in the same way as the other options. Therefore, the most likely answer is either A. tide pool or C. tidepools, as they are the options that could potentially impede the crab's movement and cause it to strain.	0.05357142857142857	0.0	0.017857142857142856	0.08333333333333333	0.09523809523809523	0.023809523809523808	0.08333333333333333	0.19642857142857142	0.047619047619047616	0.0	0.11904761904761904	0.03571428571428571	0.10714285714285714	0.0	0.011904761904761904	168

539	First, we need to determine what type of container we are talking about. Is it a storage container, a shipping container, a food container, or something else? Assuming we are talking about a general-purpose container, here are some things that could be put in it:A. Food - This could include anything from dry goods like rice and beans to perishable items like fruits and vegetables. Food containers can come in many different shapes and sizes, depending on the type of food being stored.B. Cargo ship - This is a bit of a trick question, as a cargo ship is actually a type of container itself. However, if we're talking about what goes inside a cargo ship container, it could be anything from cars and machinery to clothing and electronics.C. Refrigerator - A refrigerator is a type of container that is specifically designed to keep food and drinks cold. Inside a refrigerator, you might find things like milk, cheese, meat, and vegetables.D. Closet or garage - These are both types of storage containers that are used to keep things organized and out of sight. Inside a closet or garage container, you might find things like clothing, tools, sports equipment, and holiday decorations.E. Port - A port is not a container, but rather a location where containers are loaded and unloaded from ships. However, if we're talking about what goes inside a shipping container at a port, it could be anything from raw materials like steel and lumber to finished products like electronics and clothing.	0.02711864406779661	0.0	0.01694915254237288	0.0711864406779661	0.0847457627118644	0.010169491525423728	0.02711864406779661	0.2677966101694915	0.1152542372881356	0.0	0.0847457627118644	0.023728813559322035	0.13220338983050847	0.0	0.013559322033898305	295
540	When parents yell in times of chaos, they are usually trying to gain control of the situation. This means that the answer is C. control children. However, it is important to note that yelling is not always the most effective way to gain control and can often have negative effects on children. It is important for parents to find alternative methods of guiding and caring for their children during chaotic times.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.05194805194805195	0.09090909090909091	0.03896103896103896	0.06493506493506493	0.2077922077922078	0.1038961038961039	0.0	0.12987012987012986	0.07792207792207792	0.07792207792207792	0.0	0.012987012987012988	77

544	First, we need to consider where people are likely to generate trash. This could include areas where people eat or drink, such as restaurants, cafes, and food trucks. It could also include public spaces where people spend time, such as parks, beaches, and plazas. Additionally, trash cans may be located near public transportation hubs, such as bus stops and train stations.Based on these factors, the most likely answers are A. park, C. corner, D. bus stop, and E. store front.

546	First, we need to understand what is being judged - pigs. Then, we need to consider what is required to judge them carefully. This suggests that there may be potential pitfalls or challenges in the judging process. Option A, verdict, is a final decision or judgment made after considering all the evidence. While this may be a part of the judging process, it doesn't necessarily capture the careful consideration required. Option B, judging, is the act of evaluating or forming an opinion about something. This seems like a good fit for the question, as it directly relates to the act of judging pigs. Option C, responsibility, is a broad term that doesn't necessarily capture the specific requirements of judging pigs. Option D, evaluating, is similar to judging and could also be a good fit for the question. Option E, prejudice, is a negative bias or preconceived notion about something. This would not be a desirable trait in a pig judge, as it could lead to unfair evaluations. Based on this analysis, the best answers for the question are B. judging and D. evaluating.	0.028169014084507043	0.0	0.009389671361502348	0.056338028169014086	0.09389671361502347	0.009389671361502348	0.03286384976525822	0.20657276995305165	0.0892018779342723	0.0	0.107981220657277	0.056338028169014086	0.13615023474178403	0.0	0.014084507042253521	213

548	John loves animals and hates animal abuse, so he would likely avoid places where animals are mistreated or exploited. A. Pet store - This could go either way. Some pet stores treat their animals well, while others do not. John would need to do some research to determine which pet stores are ethical and which are not. B. Parking lot - There are no animals in a parking lot, so this is not a concern for John. C. Woodland - John would likely enjoy spending time in a woodland, as it is a natural habitat for many animals. D. North America - This is a continent, not a specific place. There are many different types of environments and animal habitats in North America, so it is impossible to say whether John would avoid it or not. E. Park - This could also go either way. Some parks have well-maintained habitats for animals, while others do not. John would need to research the specific park to determine whether it is a safe and ethical place for animals.	0.015306122448979591	0.0	0.0	0.04081632653061224	0.10714285714285714	0.030612244897959183	0.025510204081632654	0.1836734693877551	0.04591836734693878	0.0	0.09183673469387756	0.0663265306122449	0.12244897959183673	0.0	0.04081632653061224	196
549	Reading a newspaper gives you information about local current events. Option A, getting angry, is not necessarily a result of reading a newspaper. Option B, concern, is a possible result as reading about local events can make you concerned about the state of your community. Option C, worry, is similar to concern and can also be a result of reading about local events. Option D, education, is a correct answer as reading a newspaper can educate you about what is happening in your local area. Option E, learning about the world, is not necessarily a result of reading a newspaper as it focuses on local events rather than global events.

550	The lady was doing a one man show of her tell story. This means that she was the only performer on stage and was telling a story. When the show began, she would have had to do something to start the performance. Option A, persuade, doesn't make sense in this context as she is not trying to convince anyone of anything. Option B, slept, is unlikely as it would not be a good way to start a performance. Option C, take center stage, is a possibility as it would be a natural way to start a one-person show. Option D, challenge, doesn't fit the context as there is no indication that she is challenging anyone. Option E, speak clearly, is also a possibility as it would be important for her to speak clearly so that the audience can understand her story. Based on this analysis, the most likely answer is C, take center stage, or E, speak clearly.	0.03225806451612903	0.0	0.0	0.08064516129032258	0.12365591397849462	0.026881720430107527	0.026881720430107527	0.1989247311827957	0.05913978494623656	0.010752688172043012	0.10215053763440861	0.043010752688172046	0.13440860215053763	0.0	0.010752688172043012	186
551	First, we need to identify what we are looking for - a fishing rod. Next, we need to think about where we might find fishing equipment. A furniture store is unlikely to sell fishing rods, so we can eliminate option A. A fishing camp might sell fishing equipment, but it is not a common place to buy fishing rods, so we can eliminate option B. A hardware store might sell some fishing equipment, but it is not their main focus, so we can eliminate option C. A sporting goods store is a common place to buy fishing equipment, including fishing rods, so option D is a likely answer. An engine has nothing to do with fishing equipment, so we can eliminate option E. Therefore, the correct answer is D. sporting goods store.	0.0	0.0	0.05442176870748299	0.08843537414965986	0.10884353741496598	0.04081632653061224	0.013605442176870748	0.2857142857142857	0.02040816326530612	0.0	0.10884353741496598	0.04081632653061224	0.10884353741496598	0.0	0.034013605442176874	147
552	If Ali bumps into you when you are walking, the first thing to do is to make sure you are both okay and not hurt.

553	First, watching TV can provide entertainment, so option B is a possible answer. However, it is not guaranteed that the person will find the program they are watching entertaining, so option C (boredom) is also a possibility. Option A (erections) and option D (getting fat) are unlikely outcomes of watching TV, unless the person is watching a specific type of program or is snacking excessively while watching. Option E (sadness) is also a possibility if the person is watching a sad or emotional program. Therefore, the most likely answer is B (entertainment), but it ultimately depends on the individual's personal experience and the program they are watching.	0.007692307692307693	0.0	0.0	0.03076923076923077	0.1	0.038461538461538464	0.06923076923076923	0.23846153846153847	0.023076923076923078	0.0	0.1	0.06923076923076923	0.16923076923076924	0.0	0.007692307692307693	130
554	First, it's important to ensure that the shopping bag is not obstructing the driver's view or interfering with any controls. If all the seats in the vehicle are full, the best option would be to store the shopping bag in the car trunk. If the trunk is also full, the shopping bag could be placed on the floor in the backseat or in the footwell of a passenger seat, making sure it is secure and not blocking any legroom. Storing the shopping bag on the roof of the car is not recommended as it can be dangerous and may cause damage to the vehicle. Option D (retail store) and option E (home) are not relevant to the question.	0.015037593984962405	0.0	0.0	0.022556390977443608	0.10526315789473684	0.022556390977443608	0.015037593984962405	0.2556390977443609	0.09022556390977443	0.0	0.07518796992481203	0.06766917293233082	0.09774436090225563	0.0	0.007518796992481203	133
555	First, we need to identify which temple is being referred to. There are many temples in the Middle East, so we need more information. Assuming that the question is referring to a specific temple, the most likely answer is A. Jerusalem. Jerusalem is home to the Temple Mount, which is a holy site for Jews, Christians, and Muslims. The Temple Mount is the location of the First and Second Temples, which were important religious sites in ancient Jewish history. Today, the site is home to the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which are important Islamic sites. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Jerusalem.	0.016	0.0	0.016	0.024	0.096	0.008	0.032	0.144	0.072	0.0	0.048	0.104	0.144	0.0	0.128	125
556	First, people board the airplane and sit down. Then, they have to wait for the plane to take off and reach a certain altitude before they can use electronic devices. So, to pass the time before they can use electronics, people often read books, magazines, or newspapers, listen to music, watch movies on the in-flight entertainment system, chat with their travel companions, or simply take a nap. Therefore, the correct answer is A. read.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.04395604395604396	0.04395604395604396	0.0	0.06593406593406594	0.24175824175824176	0.0989010989010989	0.0	0.14285714285714285	0.03296703296703297	0.17582417582417584	0.0	0.01098901098901099	91
557	After attending school for twelve years, the most common next step would be to graduate. Graduation means that you have completed all the necessary requirements to receive a diploma or degree. This achievement can bring a sense of inspiration and accomplishment. However, it can also require much work and effort to reach this point. Some students may experience boredom or burnout after spending so much time in school, but ultimately the goal is to earn a degree or diploma that can open up new opportunities for your future. So, the answer is D. graduate.	0.009615384615384616	0.0	0.0	0.038461538461538464	0.08653846153846154	0.009615384615384616	0.057692307692307696	0.25	0.0673076923076923	0.009615384615384616	0.11538461538461539	0.057692307692307696	0.09615384615384616	0.0	0.019230769230769232	104
558	First, we know that the person has gotten a bruise, which means they have experienced physical pain. So, option D is definitely a correct answer. Next, we see that the person is expressing themselves by yelling. This suggests that they are trying to communicate something. Option B is therefore also a correct answer. Option A, self pity, may be a possible answer if the person continues to dwell on their pain and feel sorry for themselves. However, we cannot assume this based on the given information alone. Option C, understood, does not seem to fit the situation as the person is not necessarily seeking to be understood, but rather expressing their pain. Option E, embarrassment, does not seem to fit the situation either as there is no indication that the person is embarrassed about their injury or their reaction to it. Therefore, the correct answers are D (pain) and B (communication).	0.0335195530726257	0.0	0.01675977653631285	0.0782122905027933	0.0893854748603352	0.027932960893854747	0.061452513966480445	0.16759776536312848	0.0446927374301676	0.0	0.1340782122905028	0.03910614525139665	0.15083798882681565	0.0	0.00558659217877095	179
559	The helm is a device used to steer a vessel. It is typically a wheel or a tiller that controls the rudder, which is a flat piece of metal or wood that is attached to the back of the vessel and helps to steer it. Now, let's consider the options given in the question. A paddleboat and a motorboat do not have masts, so we can eliminate options B and D. A tugboat may have a mast, but it is typically used for towing other vessels and not for sailing, so we can eliminate option E. That leaves us with options A and C - a sailing vessel and a ship. Both of these types of vessels have masts that support sails, which are used to catch the wind and propel the vessel forward. Therefore, the correct answer is A. The helm is used to move the masts on a sailing vessel.	0.03614457831325301	0.0	0.018072289156626505	0.06626506024096386	0.09036144578313253	0.012048192771084338	0.030120481927710843	0.23493975903614459	0.060240963855421686	0.0	0.12048192771084337	0.018072289156626505	0.08433734939759036	0.0	0.012048192771084338	166
560	First, we need to understand that the question is asking about where the morning paper is delivered to in your home. A. Classroom: This option can be eliminated as a classroom is not typically a part of one's home. B. Synagogue: This option can also be eliminated as a synagogue is a place of worship and not a part of one's home. C. Bathroom: While it is possible for someone to read the morning paper in the bathroom, it is not typically where the paper is delivered to in one's home. D. Front porch: This option is the most likely answer as it is common for newspapers to be delivered to the front porch of a home. E. Grocery store: This option can be eliminated as it is not a part of one's home. Therefore, the correct answer is D. front porch.	0.037267080745341616	0.0	0.006211180124223602	0.043478260869565216	0.11180124223602485	0.024844720496894408	0.037267080745341616	0.21739130434782608	0.11180124223602485	0.006211180124223602	0.062111801242236024	0.037267080745341616	0.09316770186335403	0.0	0.043478260869565216	161

565	"The person in the sentence had been doing favors for everybody at work. This means that he was helping others without expecting anything in return. However, the sentence also says that he was frustrated. This means that he was not getting something that he expected or wanted. Option A, ""let down,"" means to feel disappointed or betrayed. This could be a possible answer because the person may have expected others to reciprocate his kindness, but they did not. Option B, ""respect,"" means admiration or esteem for someone. This is not a likely answer because the sentence does not mention anything about the person wanting respect. Option C, ""illness,"" means a state of being sick or unwell. This is not a likely answer because it does not relate to the context of the sentence. Option D, ""satisfaction,"" means a feeling of pleasure or contentment. This is not a likely answer because the person in the sentence is frustrated, which is the opposite of satisfaction. Option E, ""gratitude,"" means a feeling of thankfulness or appreciation. This is a likely answer because the person may have expected others to show gratitude for his help, but they did not. Therefore, the answer is E. gratitude."	0.05394190871369295	0.0	0.0	0.06224066390041494	0.0954356846473029	0.03319502074688797	0.012448132780082987	0.2074688796680498	0.06639004149377593	0.0	0.1037344398340249	0.03734439834024896	0.16597510373443983	0.0	0.0	241
566	The family is playing cards, which means they are engaging in a game. The question asks for a reason for this, so we need to consider why they would choose to play cards. Option A: Amusement - This is a possible reason. Playing cards can be a fun and entertaining activity for families to do together. Option B: Losing money - This is unlikely to be the reason, as playing cards for money is typically done in a more competitive setting, such as a casino or with friends who are serious about gambling. Option C: Charmed - This doesn't make sense as a reason for playing cards. Option D: Having fun - This is similar to option A and is a possible reason. Option E: Win money - This is also a possible reason, but it depends on the context. If the family is playing for money, then winning money would be a motivation. However, if they are just playing for fun, then this wouldn't be a reason.

568	First, we need to understand what a village is. A village is a small settlement of people, usually in a rural area. Therefore, options B and C, which refer to urban areas, can be eliminated. Option D, Ohio, is a state in the United States and not a type of area. This leaves us with options A and E, which both refer to rural areas. However, option E specifically refers to the countryside, which is more likely to contain a large village than just any rural area.

571	First, we need to identify what a binder containing homework assignments is. It is a type of folder or notebook that students use to keep track of their homework assignments. Next, we need to consider where a student would typically keep their homework assignments. The most likely answer is A. backpack, as this is where students usually store their school supplies and materials. Option B, bookcase, is unlikely as a binder containing homework assignments is a temporary storage solution for assignments that need to be completed and turned in. Option C, office supply store, is also unlikely as this is a place where students would purchase school supplies, not store their homework assignments. Option D, office, is also unlikely as this is typically a workplace for adults and not a place where students would keep their homework assignments. Option E, classroom, is possible as students may keep their binders containing homework assignments in their desks or lockers in the classroom.

Option C, the garage, could also be a possibility if the garage is located on a lower level than the main living area.

Next, we need to consider where paper-based stationery is typically sold. The options given are a bookstore, backpack, Abraham Lincoln's grave, desktop, and classroom. A backpack is not a place where stationery is sold, and Abraham Lincoln's grave is not a place where anything is sold. A desktop is a type of computer, not a place where stationery is sold.

616	First, we need to understand what a parent is. A parent is someone who has a child or children. Next, we need to consider what the role of a parent is. The primary duty of a parent is to care for their child or children. This includes providing for their basic needs such as food, shelter, and clothing, as well as ensuring their safety and well-being. While it is important for a parent to speak freely with their child and to help them succeed in school, these are not the primary duties of a parent. Similarly, while it is important for a child to be happy, a parent's duty is not solely to ensure their child's happiness.

Cupboard - This is a possible option, but it would need to be mounted above the sink and may not be the most convenient location for accessing canned food.B. Oven - This is not a suitable option for storing canned food as it is a heat source and could cause the cans to explode.C. Grocery store - This is not a storage option in the kitchen.D. Pantry - This is a possible option, but it would need to be mounted above the sink and may not be the most convenient location for accessing canned food.E. Cellar - This is not a suitable option as it is not located above the kitchen sink.Therefore, the best answer is A. cupboard or D. pantry, depending on the location and accessibility of the storage option.	0.03409090909090909	0.0	0.005681818181818182	0.028409090909090908	0.10795454545454546	0.005681818181818182	0.022727272727272728	0.19886363636363635	0.07386363636363637	0.0	0.09659090909090909	0.045454545454545456	0.10795454545454546	0.0	0.03977272727272727	176
624	First, we need to consider the purpose of the graveyard. It is a place where people can bury their loved ones and pay their respects. Therefore, it should be easily accessible to the community. Option A, Arlington, is a specific location and may not be applicable to all communities. Option B, church property, may be a good option if the church is a central location in the community and has enough space for a graveyard. Option C, out back, may not be the best option as it may not be easily accessible to the community and may not have enough space for a large graveyard. Option D, every town, may not be practical as it would require a lot of resources and may not be necessary for smaller communities. Option E, cemetery, is the most appropriate option as it is specifically designed for burials and is usually located in a central location in the community. Therefore, the answer is E, cemetery.	0.016304347826086956	0.0	0.005434782608695652	0.043478260869565216	0.14130434782608695	0.010869565217391304	0.05434782608695652	0.20652173913043478	0.08152173913043478	0.0	0.043478260869565216	0.08152173913043478	0.125	0.0	0.010869565217391304	184
625	The people wanted to take the scenic route, which means they wanted to enjoy the natural beauty of the surroundings. Option C, beach, could be a scenic route, but it is not always accessible by highway. Option B, United States, is too broad and does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Option D, atlas, is a book of maps and does not fit the context of the sentence. Option E, developed land, is unlikely to be a scenic route. Therefore, the best answer is A, countryside, as it is a common scenic route that can be accessed by highways.	0.03305785123966942	0.0	0.0	0.03305785123966942	0.10743801652892562	0.0	0.024793388429752067	0.19834710743801653	0.06611570247933884	0.0	0.0743801652892562	0.08264462809917356	0.15702479338842976	0.0	0.008264462809917356	121
626	First, we need to consider what kind of performer we are talking about. If it's a movie or film performer, then the answer would be A, cinema. However, if it's a live performer, then the answer would be either B, opera, D, stage, or E, dance, depending on the type of performance.But since the question mentions a gathering of friends, it's safe to assume that the setting is more casual and informal. Therefore, the most likely answer would be C, party, where a performer such as a musician or comedian could entertain the guests.	0.0	0.0	0.01694915254237288	0.05084745762711865	0.1016949152542373	0.0423728813559322	0.059322033898305086	0.23728813559322035	0.05084745762711865	0.0	0.059322033898305086	0.05084745762711865	0.1694915254237288	0.0	0.00847457627118644	118
627	First, we need to understand what a motorway is. A motorway is a type of road designed for high-speed traffic, typically with multiple lanes and limited access points. Next, we can eliminate options C and D, as a race track and New Jersey are not specific enough locations for a motorway. Option A, Scotland, is not incorrect as Scotland does have motorways, but it is not the most commonly associated location with motorways. Option B, Europe, is also not incorrect as many countries in Europe have motorways, but it is still not the most specific answer. Therefore, the most likely answer is E, England. England is known for its extensive motorway network, including the M1, M25, and M6, among others.	0.020689655172413793	0.0	0.013793103448275862	0.041379310344827586	0.0896551724137931	0.0	0.06896551724137931	0.18620689655172415	0.07586206896551724	0.0	0.04827586206896552	0.07586206896551724	0.16551724137931034	0.0	0.07586206896551724	145

629	When you're applying for a job, you are seeking to provide yourself with employment. This means that you are looking for a job that will provide you with work, income, and hopefully, a sense of hope for your future career prospects. An offer may come later in the process, but initially, you are seeking employment. Therefore, the correct answer is B. employment.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.10810810810810811	0.0945945945945946	0.02702702702702703	0.05405405405405406	0.1891891891891892	0.0945945945945946	0.0	0.10810810810810811	0.02702702702702703	0.14864864864864866	0.0	0.013513513513513514	74
630	The sentence states that the person called bull when his friend said something. This means that the person did not believe what his friend said. Now, we need to look at the options to see what the friend said. A. Feeble - This does not make sense in the context of the sentence. It is unlikely that the friend said a bull can be feeble. B. Bullbleep - This is a possibility. Bullbleep is a slang term for nonsense or lies. C. Cow - This is unlikely. A cow is a different animal than a bull, so it would not make sense for the friend to say that a bull can be a cow. D. Female - This is possible. A female bull is called a cow, so it is possible that the friend said a bull can be female. E. Charging prey - This is unlikely. While bulls can charge at prey, it does not make sense for the friend to say that a bull can be charging prey. Based on this analysis, the most likely answer is either B. bullbleep or D. female. Without more context, it is impossible to determine which one is correct.	0.04128440366972477	0.0	0.0045871559633027525	0.05504587155963303	0.11467889908256881	0.045871559633027525	0.009174311926605505	0.19724770642201836	0.045871559633027525	0.0	0.10550458715596331	0.05963302752293578	0.11926605504587157	0.0	0.022935779816513763	218
631	Compassionate means showing concern for others and their well-being. Thoughtful means considering the needs and feelings of others.

632	Fighting inflation means taking measures to reduce the rate of inflation. If these measures are not successful, it could lead to economic instability (option D). This is because high inflation can lead to a decrease in purchasing power, which can cause a decrease in consumer spending and investment. This can then lead to a decrease in economic growth and job creation. Additionally, if inflation is not controlled, it can lead to hyperinflation, which can cause severe economic problems such as currency devaluation and a decrease in international trade. Therefore, the correct answer is D. economic instability.	0.00909090909090909	0.0	0.0	0.01818181818181818	0.09090909090909091	0.02727272727272727	0.02727272727272727	0.24545454545454545	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.10909090909090909	0.09090909090909091	0.12727272727272726	0.0	0.00909090909090909	110
633	First, they took a break from all the rides to have lunch. This suggests that they were tired or needed a break from the excitement of the rides. Next, they were eating hamburgers and talking about what they were going to do on the next ride. This suggests that they were feeling energized and excited again. Given this context, options A, D, and E (heartburn, gas, and food poisoning) seem unlikely and not related to the situation. Option B (have fun) is a possibility, but it seems too general and doesn't specifically relate to the conversation they were having about the next ride. Therefore, the best answer is C (enjoy), as it captures the idea that they were discussing their plans for the next ride and looking forward to it.	0.07142857142857142	0.0	0.0	0.07792207792207792	0.07792207792207792	0.01948051948051948	0.045454545454545456	0.16233766233766234	0.07142857142857142	0.0	0.11688311688311688	0.05194805194805195	0.14935064935064934	0.0	0.012987012987012988	154

635	First, we know that we do not have rest. This implies that we have been active or busy without taking a break. Next, we need to consider how this lack of rest would make us feel. Option A, exhausted, seems like the most likely answer. When we don't rest, our bodies and minds become fatigued and drained, leading to feelings of exhaustion. Option B, lonely, does not seem to be related to the lack of rest. Option C, worked all day, is a possibility, but it doesn't capture the full extent of how we might feel without rest. Option D, were very tired, is similar to option A and could be a valid answer. Option E, feel better, is unlikely since we have established that we do not have rest. Therefore, the best answer is A. exhausted.	0.04242424242424243	0.0	0.06060606060606061	0.06666666666666667	0.12121212121212122	0.04242424242424243	0.030303030303030304	0.15757575757575756	0.05454545454545454	0.0	0.12121212121212122	0.07878787878787878	0.15757575757575756	0.0	0.012121212121212121	165
636	First, we need to find a place where we can purchase food. Option B, fast food restaurant, fits this criteria as they sell food for customers to purchase.

638	The question is asking for a term that describes socializing through trivial conversations. Trivial conversations are typically casual and not deep or meaningful. Therefore, we can eliminate options A, B, and E as they suggest a broader or more general meaning. Option C is also too general and does not specifically refer to the type of conversation being had. The correct answer is D, small talk, as it specifically refers to casual and superficial conversation used for socializing.	0.022727272727272728	0.0	0.011363636363636364	0.045454545454545456	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.06818181818181818	0.1590909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.1590909090909091	0.11363636363636363	0.0	0.0	88

640	Sarah found the poison in the cabinet and thought it was something else. Option A suggests that she thought it was drinkable, but poison is not something that is meant to be consumed. Option B suggests that she thought it was junk food, which is unlikely as poison does not resemble any type of food. Option C suggests that she thought it was medicine, which is a possibility as some medicines can be harmful if taken in the wrong dosage or by the wrong person. Option D suggests that she thought it was an antidote, which is unlikely as an antidote is used to counteract the effects of a poison, not to cause harm. Option E suggests that she thought it was a nutrient, which is also unlikely as poison is not a nutrient. Therefore, the most likely answer is C. Sarah took the poison by accident because she thought it was medicine.	0.11976047904191617	0.0	0.0	0.09580838323353294	0.11976047904191617	0.041916167664670656	0.023952095808383235	0.18562874251497005	0.059880239520958084	0.0	0.12574850299401197	0.04790419161676647	0.08383233532934131	0.0	0.011976047904191617	167
641	"The question states that some stores trick women to buy products. This means that the stores are using deceptive tactics to encourage women to make purchases. The question then goes on to say that the sales make it seem like if you buy more, you will get something. Option A, get money, doesn't make sense in this context. The question is about stores tricking women into buying products, not about women earning money. Option B, pay money, is already a given when making a purchase. It doesn't answer the question of what the sales are making it seem like women will get if they buy more. Option C, go shopping, is not an answer to the question. It's just a general statement that doesn't address the specific scenario presented in the question. Option D, lose money, is also not an answer to the question. It's possible that women may end up spending more money than they intended due to the deceptive sales tactics, but the question is asking about what the sales are making it seem like women will get if they buy more. Option E, save money, is the most likely answer. Many stores use sales tactics such as ""buy one, get one free"" or ""spend $50, get $10 off"" to make it seem like customers are getting a good deal and saving money by buying more. However, it's important to be aware of these tactics and make sure that you're actually getting a good deal before making a purchase."	0.01020408163265306	0.0	0.0	0.061224489795918366	0.07482993197278912	0.030612244897959183	0.027210884353741496	0.20068027210884354	0.07482993197278912	0.013605442176870748	0.17346938775510204	0.06462585034013606	0.11564625850340136	0.0	0.01020408163265306	294

645	"First, it's important to note that different religions and belief systems may have different perspectives on what God wants people to do for money. However, in general, many religious teachings emphasize the importance of hard work and responsible stewardship of resources.A. Work in life: Many religious teachings emphasize the importance of working hard and using one's talents and abilities to contribute to society and provide for oneself and one's family. For example, in Christianity, the Bible says, ""Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters"" (Colossians 3:23).B. Speak to people: While communication and interpersonal skills are important in many aspects of life, it's not necessarily clear how this relates specifically to money. However, some religious teachings emphasize the importance of honesty and integrity in all interactions, including financial transactions.C. Everywhere: This answer is too vague to provide a clear response. It's not clear what is meant by ""everywhere"" in this context.D. Sitting idle: Many religious teachings emphasize the importance of being productive and using one's time wisely. Sitting idle and not contributing to society or working to provide for oneself and one's family is generally not seen as a positive thing.E. Care for people: While caring for others is an important value in many religious teachings, it's not necessarily clear how this relates specifically to money. However, some religious teachings emphasize the importance of generosity and giving to those in need, which can involve using one's financial resources to help others.Overall, it's important to remember that different religious teachings may emphasize different values and priorities when it comes to money and work. However, many religious teachings emphasize the importance of hard work, responsible stewardship of resources, honesty and integrity, and caring for others."	0.005681818181818182	0.0	0.0	0.05113636363636364	0.048295454545454544	0.019886363636363636	0.045454545454545456	0.19602272727272727	0.11079545454545454	0.002840909090909091	0.10511363636363637	0.11079545454545454	0.12215909090909091	0.0	0.017045454545454544	352

In some countries, a prescription may be required to purchase certain types of contraceptive devices, while in others, they may be available over-the-counter (OTC) without a prescription. Based on this information, we can eliminate options D and E as they are not relevant to the question. Option A, pharmacy, may be a possible answer as pharmacies often sell contraceptive devices. However, it may depend on the country and the specific type of device. Option C, drugstore, is similar to a pharmacy and may also sell contraceptive devices.

666	Lilly owns the only kosher deli in the area, which means that there is a demand for kosher food in the area. However, she isn't in a heavily populated area, which suggests that the area may not have a large Jewish population. Option A, food court, is unlikely as a kosher deli would not typically be located in a food court. Option B, Jerusalem, is not relevant as it is a city in Israel and not related to the location of Lilly's deli. Option C, New York City, is a heavily populated area with a large Jewish population, which could potentially support multiple kosher delis. However, the fact that Lilly owns the only kosher deli in the area suggests that she does not live in New York City. Option D, Jewish community, is a possibility as it suggests that Lilly may live in an area with a significant Jewish population that would support a kosher deli. Option E, town, is a general term and could apply to a variety of locations. However, based on the information provided, it is possible that Lilly lives in a smaller town or suburb with a smaller Jewish population. Therefore, the most likely answer is D, Jewish community, but E, town, is also a possibility.	0.020491803278688523	0.0	0.0	0.028688524590163935	0.08196721311475409	0.02459016393442623	0.040983606557377046	0.18032786885245902	0.0860655737704918	0.0	0.06967213114754098	0.11065573770491803	0.13114754098360656	0.0	0.06147540983606557	244

669	First, we need to identify what a fiddle is. A fiddle is a colloquial term for a violin, often used in traditional or folk music. Next, we need to think about where there might be a large number of violins/fiddles. A. Tennessee is known for its country music and bluegrass, which often feature the fiddle, so it's a possibility. B. Band practice could have multiple fiddles, but it's unlikely to have tens of thousands. C. An orchestra typically has a large number of string instruments, including violins, but again, tens of thousands is unlikely. D. A violin case is where an individual would store their own violin, so it's not a place where there would be a large number of fiddles. E. A music store could have a large inventory of violins/fiddles, but tens of thousands is again unlikely. Therefore, the most likely answer is A. Tennessee.	0.011428571428571429	0.0	0.011428571428571429	0.05714285714285714	0.12	0.022857142857142857	0.05142857142857143	0.2342857142857143	0.06285714285714286	0.0	0.05142857142857143	0.06857142857142857	0.12	0.0	0.02857142857142857	175
670	"First, we know that James used a cannon to shoot at something. This implies that whatever he shot at was likely large or sturdy enough to require such a powerful weapon. Next, we know that James was seeking lunch. This suggests that he may have been hunting for food. Finally, we are told that using the cannon was ""overkill."" This implies that James used more force than was necessary to accomplish his goal. Putting all of this together, we can infer that James likely shot at an animal while hunting for food. The fact that he used a cannon suggests that he may have been targeting a particularly large or dangerous animal, such as a bear or a buffalo. However, the fact that using the cannon was ""overkill"" suggests that he may have been able to accomplish his goal with a less powerful weapon. Therefore, the most likely answer is E. animal."	0.08092485549132948	0.0	0.023121387283236993	0.06936416184971098	0.09826589595375723	0.06936416184971098	0.06936416184971098	0.12716763005780346	0.05202312138728324	0.0	0.14450867052023122	0.06358381502890173	0.12138728323699421	0.0	0.028901734104046242	173
671	If you are successful when committing suicide, it means that you have ended your life. Therefore, you will not experience any physical or emotional pain anymore. However, your loved ones and those who care about you will experience sorrow and misery. They will be left with scars and emotional trauma that may last a lifetime. Additionally, if you believe in an afterlife, you may face consequences for taking your own life.

672	James has a report due tomorrow, which means he needs to work on it today. Option A, university, is too broad and doesn't give us any indication of where James might be spending his time. Option B, college class, suggests that James might be attending a class, but it doesn't necessarily mean he'll be working on his report during that time. Option C, class room, is similar to option B and doesn't give us any specific information about where James might be spending his time. Option D, classroom, is the same as option C and doesn't provide any additional information. Option E, library, is the most likely answer. If James has a report due tomorrow, he'll need to spend time researching and writing it. The library is a common place for students to work on assignments, especially if they need access to books, articles, or other resources. Therefore, the correct answer is E, library.	0.0	0.0	0.0106951871657754	0.06417112299465241	0.11229946524064172	0.026737967914438502	0.026737967914438502	0.22459893048128343	0.053475935828877004	0.0	0.0962566844919786	0.058823529411764705	0.1443850267379679	0.0	0.0481283422459893	187

674	The sentence states that his running escape didn't last long once he tripped. This means that he was not able to continue running after he tripped. The question asks what he should have thought to do. Option A, tie shoelace, could be a possible answer as it suggests that he may have tripped due to his shoelaces being untied. However, this is not explicitly stated in the sentence. Option B, rest, does not make sense as resting would not help him escape from whatever he was running from. Option C, tiredness, is not relevant to the situation as there is no indication that he was too tired to continue running. Option D, run longer, is not possible as he already tripped and was unable to continue running. Option E, sit down, is not a good option as it would make him an easy target for whatever he was running from. Therefore, the best answer would be A, tie shoelace, as it is a possible reason for him tripping and could have prevented him from falling.	0.07	0.0	0.0	0.105	0.135	0.025	0.035	0.14	0.09	0.0	0.145	0.05	0.12	0.0	0.0	200

679	When people do not have enough food, their bodies start to experience malnutrition. This means that they are not getting the necessary nutrients and energy to function properly. As a result, they may feel weak, tired, and lethargic. If this continues for a prolonged period of time, their bodies will start to break down their own tissues for energy, leading to muscle wasting and organ failure. Ultimately, if they do not receive enough food, they will die of starvation.

687	First, we need to identify the common thread among the options. All of them involve some form of creativity or self-expression. Next, we need to consider which of these options could realistically be a full-time job. While all of them have the potential to be a career, some may be more viable than others. Sewing, for example, could be a career as a fashion designer or tailor, but it may not be as common as the other options. Singing and dancing could lead to a career in the performing arts, but it may be more competitive and difficult to break into. Creating art, expressing oneself, and writing, on the other hand, have a wider range of potential career paths. Artists can sell their work, work in graphic design or advertising, or become art teachers. Expressing oneself could lead to careers in writing, public speaking, or counseling. Writing can lead to careers in journalism, publishing, or screenwriting. Therefore, the answer is E. write, as it has the most potential for a full-time career and is a common profession.	0.0	0.0	0.009389671361502348	0.046948356807511735	0.09389671361502347	0.004694835680751174	0.03755868544600939	0.22535211267605634	0.09859154929577464	0.0	0.07981220657276995	0.06572769953051644	0.15492957746478872	0.0	0.004694835680751174	213

If Sam is really unhappy with the people he's met, he may decide to cut his trip short and return home. Option B, taking an airplane, could also work. Sam could fly to a different location and start fresh with new people. Option C, learning from each other, doesn't really address the issue of Sam not liking the people he's met. It's possible that he could learn something from them, but it doesn't solve the problem of him wanting to get away from them. Option D, going out, could be a way for Sam to meet new people and potentially find some that he likes better. However, it doesn't necessarily mean he'll be able to completely distance himself from the people he didn't like. Option E, making art, doesn't really address the issue either. While it could be a way for Sam to express himself and potentially meet new people, it doesn't solve the problem of him not liking the people he's currently with. Based on these options, the best answer would be either A or B, depending on how much Sam wants to continue traveling. If he's really unhappy, he may choose to come home.

709	"The children saw Superman fly overhead. This is an exciting and unexpected event. Therefore, they would likely exclaim something that expresses their amazement or excitement. Option A, ""ouch,"" does not make sense in this context as there is no reason for the children to feel pain. Option B, ""skip,"" is also unlikely as it does not relate to the situation at hand. Option C, ""enjoyed,"" is not a suitable response as it is a past tense verb and does not express the children's immediate reaction to seeing Superman fly overhead. Option D, ""awesome,"" is the most appropriate response as it expresses excitement and amazement. Option E, ""watch television,"" is not a suitable response as it does not relate to the situation at hand.

714	First, we need to understand what bags are used for when it comes to marijuana. Typically, bags are used to store and transport marijuana. Next, we need to consider what benefits storing marijuana in bags might have. One possible benefit is that bags can help keep the marijuana organized and contained, preventing it from spilling or getting mixed up with other substances. Given these considerations, the most likely answer is B. neat. Storing marijuana in bags can help keep it neat and organized.

716	The question mentions that everybody seemed to have a horse, which suggests that it is a popular event. The options given are race track, Kentucky Derby, American Southwest, Triple Crown, and Horse Derby. The American Southwest is a region, not an event, so we can eliminate option C. The Triple Crown is a series of three races (Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, and Belmont Stakes), so it is not a single event. The Horse Derby is not a commonly used term, and it is not clear what event it refers to. This leaves us with options A and B. While a race track can host many different events, the Kentucky Derby is one of the most famous and prestigious horse races in the world, and it is known for drawing large crowds and widespread attention.

717	First, the person should try to assess the severity of their wounds and determine if they need immediate medical attention. If the wounds are severe, they should try to call for help using a phone or other communication device if available. If they are unable to call for help, they should try to make themselves visible to others by creating a signal or marking a trail.If the wounds are not severe, the person should try to clean and dress the wounds to prevent infection. They should also try to find a source of shelter and warmth to protect themselves from the elements.In any case, the person should try to stay calm and conserve their energy while waiting for help to arrive. It is important to remember that being alone in the woods and wounded can be a dangerous situation, and seeking medical attention as soon as possible is crucial for recovery.

718	When a company goes public, it means that it is offering shares of its ownership to the public for the first time. This is done through an initial public offering (IPO). The main reason for a company to go public is to raise more funding. By selling shares to the public, the company can raise a significant amount of capital that can be used to fund growth, research and development, and other business activities. Going public also allows the company to increase its visibility and credibility, which can attract more investors and customers. Additionally, going public can provide liquidity for existing shareholders, allowing them to sell their shares and realize a profit. Therefore, the correct answer is D. more funding.	0.014598540145985401	0.0	0.0	0.051094890510948905	0.06569343065693431	0.014598540145985401	0.021897810218978103	0.22627737226277372	0.06569343065693431	0.0	0.145985401459854	0.0948905109489051	0.12408759124087591	0.0	0.021897810218978103	137

The center table is typically reserved for the bride and groom, along with their immediate family and the wedding party.If it is a reception at a restaurant or other event venue, then the answer could vary. It may be the host or hostess of the event, a guest of honor, or simply a decorative centerpiece.If it is a reception in a church basement or corridor, then the answer may also vary depending on the purpose of the reception. It could be the organizers of the event, a guest of honor, or simply a table for refreshments.Therefore, the answer to this question depends on the specific context of the reception.	0.006289308176100629	0.0	0.012578616352201259	0.050314465408805034	0.08176100628930817	0.018867924528301886	0.05660377358490566	0.27044025157232704	0.1069182389937107	0.0	0.050314465408805034	0.025157232704402517	0.11949685534591195	0.0	0.006289308176100629	159
731	The clothing was extremely expensive compared to other places. This means that it was not a common or average price for clothing. Option A, cinema hall, is unlikely as cinema halls do not typically sell clothing. Option B, mall, is a possibility as malls often have a variety of stores with different price ranges. However, it is not specific enough as some stores in malls can be expensive while others are not. Option C, department store, is a strong possibility as department stores often have a range of clothing brands and prices. Some department stores are known for carrying high-end designer brands that can be very expensive. Option D, closet, is not a likely option as clothing cannot be purchased from a closet. Option E, shop, is also a possibility as there are many types of shops that sell clothing, from small boutique shops to high-end luxury shops. Overall, the most likely answer is C, department store, as it is known for carrying a range of clothing brands and prices, including expensive designer brands.	0.02926829268292683	0.0	0.0	0.02926829268292683	0.1073170731707317	0.00975609756097561	0.04878048780487805	0.3024390243902439	0.0975609756097561	0.0	0.04878048780487805	0.08292682926829269	0.13658536585365855	0.0	0.0	205
732	To print, you need a tool that can apply ink onto a surface. Option A, squid, is not a practical choice as it is not a tool.

733	First, a restaurant would put a candle on a birthday cake if they were celebrating a customer's birthday. So, option E is a possibility, but it's not a general answer. Second, a restaurant would typically put candles on tables to create a cozy and romantic atmosphere. So, option D is the most likely answer. Option A is also a possibility, as a candle can be used to add to the ambiance of a dimly lit room. Option B is unlikely, as a candle in the kitchen could be a fire hazard.

Wine should be stored in a cool, dark, and humid place, with a consistent temperature between 45-65°F (7-18°C) and a humidity level of around 70%. With that in mind, we can eliminate options A, C, D, and E. An attic is typically too hot and dry, an art show is not a suitable storage environment, a church may not have the necessary conditions, and a bar may not have the space or proper storage equipment. That leaves us with option B, basement, which is often a popular choice for wine storage due to its cool and consistent temperature.

746	When people compete against someone, they usually want to win. This desire to win can stem from a variety of reasons, such as wanting to prove oneself, wanting to achieve a goal, or wanting to gain recognition. In order to win, people often look for an edge, which could be a particular skill or strategy that gives them an advantage over their opponent. However, competition can also create a sense of rivalry between individuals, which can be fueled by a desire to outdo or surpass the other person. While friendship can exist between competitors, it is not typically what people look for when competing against someone.

Therefore, we can eliminate options C, D, and E as they are not related to the natural habitat of a beaver.Next, we know that beavers build dams and lodges in bodies of water, so the most likely answer is B, a body of water. However, beavers also live in wooded areas near bodies of water, so option A could also be a possible answer.Therefore, the correct answers are A and B, a wooded area or a body of water.	0.008064516129032258	0.0	0.024193548387096774	0.04838709677419355	0.06451612903225806	0.024193548387096774	0.06451612903225806	0.25806451612903225	0.0967741935483871	0.0	0.06451612903225806	0.07258064516129033	0.13709677419354838	0.0	0.008064516129032258	124

That leaves us with option B, ""east side."" However, without any further context or information about the artist, it's difficult to say for sure if this is the correct answer. It's possible that the artist was famous for using plain or muted colors in their work, regardless of the subject matter.

779	The sentence mentions a beach with shallow water, which rules out options A, D, and E. The sentence also implies that this location is popular among locals, which suggests that it is easily accessible and well-known. This makes option B, a pond, less likely since ponds are not typically popular swimming spots. Therefore, the most likely answer is C, a lake, which can have beaches and shallow areas suitable for swimming and is often a popular destination for locals.	0.010752688172043012	0.0	0.0	0.010752688172043012	0.07526881720430108	0.03225806451612903	0.08602150537634409	0.23655913978494625	0.053763440860215055	0.0	0.06451612903225806	0.0967741935483871	0.13978494623655913	0.0	0.0	93

781	The person wants to avoid the cabbage spoiling, which means they need to keep it fresh. The options given are grocery store, refrigerator, freezer, plate, and supermarket. A. Grocery store: This option doesn't make sense because the person already has the cabbage and wants to keep it fresh, not buy a new one from the store. B. Refrigerator: This is a good option because refrigerators are designed to keep food fresh and prevent spoilage. C. Freezer: While freezing can also preserve food, it may not be the best option for cabbage as it can affect its texture and taste. D. Plate: This option doesn't make sense because a plate is not a storage solution for keeping food fresh. E. Supermarket: This option is similar to A and doesn't make sense because the person already has the cabbage. Therefore, the best answer is B.

783	First, we need to identify what zebras are. Zebras are animals, specifically a type of wild horse with black and white stripes. Next, we need to think about where animals are typically found. While some animals may be found in the wild, it is not always safe or practical for people to go searching for them there. Therefore, the most likely answer is A. zoo. Zoos are places where animals are kept for public viewing and education. Many zoos have exhibits specifically for zebras, where visitors can observe them in a safe and controlled environment. B. museum, C. hospital, D. desk, and E. opera are all unlikely places to find zebras. Museums typically display artifacts and artwork, hospitals are for medical treatment, desks are for work, and operas are for musical performances.	0.026143790849673203	0.0	0.013071895424836602	0.0392156862745098	0.09803921568627451	0.026143790849673203	0.06535947712418301	0.24183006535947713	0.0784313725490196	0.0	0.08496732026143791	0.0784313725490196	0.13725490196078433	0.0	0.0196078431372549	153
784	First, we need to consider the fact that the person is sitting over a bowl of water for an extended period. This suggests that the activity is likely related to some form of personal hygiene or relaxation. Option A, bathroom, seems like a plausible answer as people often sit over a bowl of water to wash their face or soak their feet. Option B, solar system, is not relevant to the question and can be eliminated. Option C, coffee shop, and option E, airport, do not seem like appropriate places for someone to sit over a bowl of water for an extended period. Option D, space shuttle, is also not a likely answer as there would be limited space and resources for such an activity.

785	First, we know that the window across the street was broken. Then, we learn that John felt guilty about it. Finally, we are told that he never meant to damage something. Therefore, the answer is not A (friend's house) or D (front door) because those options suggest that John intentionally caused damage to a specific property. It is also not C (space shuttle) or E (classroom) because those options are not relevant to the context of the sentence. That leaves us with option B (curtains) as the most likely answer. John may have accidentally thrown a ball or object that broke the window and damaged the curtains inside.	0.06923076923076923	0.0	0.03076923076923077	0.06923076923076923	0.05384615384615385	0.046153846153846156	0.07692307692307693	0.18461538461538463	0.05384615384615385	0.0	0.1	0.038461538461538464	0.16153846153846155	0.0	0.03076923076923077	130
786	If you have a forgiving attitude toward someone, it means that you are willing to let go of any anger or resentment you may have towards them for something they have done. This can lead to a few different outcomes for the person you are forgiving:A. Redemption: Forgiveness can be a powerful tool for helping someone to redeem themselves. If they have done something wrong and you forgive them, it can help them to feel like they have been given a second chance and can work to make things right.B. Isolation: If you forgive someone but still choose to cut them out of your life, they may feel isolated and alone. This can be a negative outcome of forgiveness if it leads to further hurt and pain for the person you are forgiving.C. Absolution: Forgiveness can also be seen as a form of absolution, where you are releasing someone from any guilt or shame they may feel for their actions. This can be a powerful gift to give someone, as it can help them to move on from their mistakes and start fresh.D. Great relief: Forgiveness can bring great relief to someone who has done something wrong. If they have been carrying around guilt or shame for their actions, your forgiveness can help to lift that burden and allow them to move forward.E. Feel better: Finally, forgiveness can simply make someone feel better. If they have hurt you or done something wrong, they may be carrying around a lot of negative emotions. Your forgiveness can help to ease those emotions and allow them to feel better about themselves and their actions.	0.029801324503311258	0.0	0.0	0.16225165562913907	0.11589403973509933	0.026490066225165563	0.023178807947019868	0.11920529801324503	0.08278145695364239	0.0	0.1490066225165563	0.06291390728476821	0.08609271523178808	0.0	0.006622516556291391	302
787	First, the person was shopping at a car dealership, which means they were likely looking at cars or talking to someone about purchasing a car. Next, the question asks what a salesman did. A salesman is someone who sells products, so it's safe to assume that the person in question was approached by a salesman who was trying to sell them a car. Therefore, the answer is A. appear suddenly, as the salesman likely approached the person while they were shopping. The other options (bottom out, go downtown, scream, roll over) do not make sense in the context of a car dealership and salesperson.	0.06611570247933884	0.0	0.0	0.0743801652892562	0.08264462809917356	0.01652892561983471	0.049586776859504134	0.2066115702479339	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.14049586776859505	0.01652892561983471	0.1322314049586777	0.0	0.008264462809917356	121
788	The fact that two sides were able to reach a tentative agreement means that they were able to come to some sort of understanding or compromise. This suggests that they were previously in disagreement or conflict. Therefore, the feat achieved here is likely to be A. accomplish, as they were able to achieve something that was difficult or challenging. Option B, make progress, is also a possible answer, but it is not as specific as option A. Options C, stop arguing, and E, concert, are not accurate as they do not fully capture the achievement of reaching a tentative agreement.

789	The police man was waving flares, which suggests that he was directing traffic or signaling something to drivers. The question specifically asks what he did with the impatient car, which implies that the car was not following his directions or was trying to bypass the traffic flow. Therefore, the most likely answer is D. direct traffic, as the police officer was likely trying to control the flow of cars and prevent accidents. It is possible that he also had a word with the driver, but this is not explicitly stated in the question. A, B, and C are not relevant to the scenario described. E. wave on is also a possibility, but it does not necessarily address the issue of the impatient car.	0.06569343065693431	0.0	0.0	0.058394160583941604	0.0948905109489051	0.021897810218978103	0.058394160583941604	0.2116788321167883	0.06569343065693431	0.0	0.10948905109489052	0.043795620437956206	0.10218978102189781	0.0	0.0072992700729927005	137
790	First, garbage is usually collected and taken to a landfill or a dumpster. So options B and C are possible answers. However, the question is asking where you watch garbage, not where it is stored. Option A, television, could be a possible answer if you are watching a show or documentary about garbage. Option D, Fox News, is not a relevant answer as it does not relate to garbage. Option E, trashcan, is not a possible answer as you do not watch garbage in a trashcan.

791	First, we need to identify where people are breathing. Option A, charming, does not make sense as it is not a location where people gather to breathe. Option B, space shuttle, is also unlikely as it is a controlled environment with limited human presence. Option C, house, could be a possibility if there are many people living in the same house and the air is not well-ventilated. Option D, train station, is a good possibility as it is a public transportation hub where many people pass through and breathe the same air. Option E, surface of earth, is too broad and does not specify a location where people gather to breathe.

793	First, the judge conducts a trial to determine if the person is guilty of the crime. If the person is found guilty, the judge then brings in a verdict, which is a formal decision or judgment. Finally, the judge passes sentence, which is the punishment or penalty for the crime committed. So the correct answer is D. pass sentence.

Therefore, the answer is either A or C, depending on which location the man was looking to install the flooring.	0.0410958904109589	0.0	0.0	0.0547945205479452	0.07534246575342465	0.02054794520547945	0.0273972602739726	0.22602739726027396	0.0273972602739726	0.00684931506849315	0.15753424657534246	0.0	0.1506849315068493	0.0	0.0136986301369863	146
796	First, we need to identify what we are looking for - pamphlets regarding diseases and ailments. A. Theaters - This option is unlikely as theaters typically do not distribute health-related pamphlets. B. Health department - This option is a strong possibility as health departments often provide educational materials on diseases and ailments. C. Library - This option is also a strong possibility as libraries often have a health section with pamphlets and books on various health topics. D. Drawer - This option is unlikely as it is too vague and does not specify where the drawer is located. E. Mailbox - This option is unlikely as it is not common for pamphlets on diseases and ailments to be distributed through mailboxes.

799	"The question is asking what Mark didn't want to continue existing in. The phrase ""continue existing"" implies that Mark was already existing in something. So, we need to look for a word that describes a state of being that Mark was already in and didn't want to continue in. Option A, ""understand,"" doesn't make sense in this context because understanding is not a state of being that Mark could exist in. Option B, ""were there,"" is grammatically incorrect and doesn't make sense in this context. Option C, ""ignorance,"" is a state of being that Mark could exist in. If Mark didn't want to continue existing in ignorance, it means he wanted to know the truth and not remain uninformed or unaware. This option is the correct answer. Option D, ""in-between,"" doesn't make sense in this context because it doesn't describe a specific state of being that Mark could exist in. Option E, ""ignorant,"" is similar to option C, but it's an adjective rather than a noun. While it's possible to say ""Mark didn't want to continue being ignorant,"" the more natural phrasing would be ""Mark didn't want to continue existing in ignorance.""

800	First, we need to understand what milk is. Milk is a nutrient-rich liquid that is produced by female mammals to feed their young. So, we can eliminate options A, D, and E as they are not animals. Next, we need to identify which animal produces milk. While some other animals like goats, sheep, and buffalo also produce milk, the most common and widely consumed milk comes from cows. Therefore, the correct answer is C. cow. Option B, pig, is incorrect as pigs do not produce milk that is consumed by humans.	0.02702702702702703	0.0	0.02702702702702703	0.07207207207207207	0.08108108108108109	0.009009009009009009	0.06306306306306306	0.1981981981981982	0.05405405405405406	0.0	0.11711711711711711	0.07207207207207207	0.17117117117117117	0.0	0.018018018018018018	111
801	First, we need to identify where disease can be spread. Disease can be spread through contact with infected individuals, contaminated surfaces, and through the air. Next, we need to consider where disease shouldn't be spread. Ideally, disease should not be spread in places where people are vulnerable to infection, such as hospitals or nursing homes. Therefore, the answer is E. hospital. Disease should not be spread in hospitals, but unfortunately, it often is due to the close proximity of sick individuals and the potential for contaminated surfaces and equipment.	0.06666666666666667	0.0	0.01904761904761905	0.02857142857142857	0.12380952380952381	0.02857142857142857	0.05714285714285714	0.2	0.09523809523809523	0.0	0.10476190476190476	0.05714285714285714	0.14285714285714285	0.0	0.009523809523809525	105
802	First, we need to understand what a beaver is and what it does. A beaver is a large, semi-aquatic rodent that is known for building dams and lodges. These structures are built using branches, mud, and other materials, and are designed to create a pond or lake that the beaver can live in.So, what does a beaver block with these structures? The answer is C. body of water. Beavers build dams to create ponds or lakes, which they use as their homes. The dams also help to regulate the water level in the area, which can be important for other animals and plants that live nearby. So, if you see a beaver building a structure, it's likely that they are trying to block a stream or river in order to create a new body of water.	0.0189873417721519	0.0	0.006329113924050633	0.0759493670886076	0.08227848101265822	0.0189873417721519	0.03164556962025317	0.22784810126582278	0.056962025316455694	0.0	0.12658227848101267	0.056962025316455694	0.11392405063291139	0.0	0.012658227848101266	158
803	First, we need to consider what kind of protection is needed from a cannon. Cannons are large, powerful weapons that can cause significant damage to a person's body. Therefore, we need to think about protection that can withstand the force of a cannonball.A. Ungulate: This is a type of animal, such as a deer or a horse. Wearing an ungulate would not provide any protection from a cannon.B. Bomber: This is a type of military aircraft. Wearing a bomber would not provide any protection from a cannon.C. Body armor: This is a type of protective clothing that is designed to absorb and deflect the impact of bullets and other projectiles. Body armor would be a good choice for protecting oneself from a cannon.D. Tank: This is a heavily armored military vehicle that is designed to withstand direct hits from cannons and other weapons. A tank would be an excellent choice for protecting oneself from a cannon, but it is not something that a person can wear.E. Hat: Wearing a hat would not provide any protection from a cannon.Therefore, the best answer is C. Body armor.	0.013888888888888888	0.0	0.009259259259259259	0.05555555555555555	0.09259259259259259	0.0	0.018518518518518517	0.2175925925925926	0.08333333333333333	0.0	0.09722222222222222	0.06481481481481481	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.018518518518518517	216
804	The statement is saying that society cannot exist without numbers. This means that numbers are essential for the functioning of society. So, where do numbers come into play in society? A. Population: Numbers are used to count the population of a society. This is important for understanding the needs and resources of a community. B. Populated area: Similar to population, numbers are used to count the number of people living in a specific area. C. Create government: Numbers are used in the creation of government, such as in the counting of votes during elections. D. Group of people: Numbers are used to count the number of people in a group, which is important for organizing and planning events. E. Make person sick: This option is not related to the statement and is therefore incorrect.

806	John couldn't find a place to stay, so he needed to find a place that was inexpensive. This rules out options like hotels and luxury accommodations. He also didn't want to waste money, so he likely chose a budget-friendly option. Based on these clues, the most likely answer is E. motel. Motels are often cheaper than hotels and offer fewer amenities. They are also commonly found in towns and cities, which are more likely places for John to be looking for lodging. A farm is unlikely to offer lodging, and a town or city is a more practical option for finding a place to stay.	0.049586776859504134	0.0	0.0	0.04132231404958678	0.08264462809917356	0.0	0.08264462809917356	0.19834710743801653	0.06611570247933884	0.0	0.1322314049586777	0.06611570247933884	0.10743801652892562	0.0	0.024793388429752067	121
807	First, we need to understand that the person is not happy to take their car somewhere. This means they have a negative feeling about taking their car to a certain place. A. Down a river - This option doesn't make sense as it's not a place where someone would take their car. B. City - This option is too broad and doesn't give us enough information to determine if someone would be happy or unhappy to take their car there. C. Repair shop - This option is a likely candidate for someone not being happy to take their car. If someone's car needs repairs, they may not be happy about having to spend money or deal with the inconvenience of not having their car for a period of time. D. Parking lot - This option doesn't necessarily make sense as a place someone would be unhappy to take their car. E. Neighbor's house - This option doesn't make sense as it's not a place where someone would typically take their car. Therefore, the answer is C.

Option B, music room, could be a possibility, but it is not a common living area in a house. Options C and D, college and university, are institutions and not places where someone lives permanently. Therefore, the most likely answer is E, house, as it is a common living area where someone might have space for an upright piano.	0.009259259259259259	0.0	0.0	0.06481481481481481	0.10185185185185185	0.027777777777777776	0.037037037037037035	0.23148148148148148	0.027777777777777776	0.0	0.046296296296296294	0.07407407407407407	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.009259259259259259	108
809	First, we need to identify which type of musical ensemble typically includes both string and brass instruments. The answer is D. orchestra.

810	Traders are people who buy and sell stocks. They work on the floor, which means they are physically present in a specific location. This location is not a building or a hallway, as those are too broad and do not accurately describe the specific area where traders work. It is also not a table or an office, as those are too small and do not accommodate the large number of traders who work together. Therefore, the correct answer is D. exchange, which refers to a specific location where traders gather to buy and sell stocks.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.047619047619047616	0.08571428571428572	0.01904761904761905	0.06666666666666667	0.18095238095238095	0.05714285714285714	0.0	0.11428571428571428	0.0761904761904762	0.09523809523809523	0.0	0.009523809523809525	105
811	"The question is asking for a word that describes the behavior of the real estate agent in order to gain the trust of someone. The word ""manipulate"" has a negative connotation and implies that the agent was using underhanded tactics to gain trust, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer. The word ""charming"" is a positive adjective that describes someone who is pleasant and likable, which fits the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is B. charming. The words ""deceive"" and ""exaggerate"" both have negative connotations and imply that the agent was not being truthful, which is not necessarily the case in this sentence.

813	Small grapes can be used in various ways, but the most common use is in wine production. Therefore, the correct answer is B. wine press. Small grapes are preferred for wine production as they have a higher skin-to-juice ratio, which results in a more concentrated flavor and color. However, small grapes can also be used in fruit cocktails, as they add a burst of sweetness and flavor. They can also be used in the kitchen for cooking and baking, such as in jams, jellies, and pies.

814	If there are rumors of roving bands of monsters killing people, people may become afraid and panic (option A). This panic could then lead to mass hysteria (option C), where people start to believe the rumors without any evidence. In extreme cases, this could lead to people taking matters into their own hands and committing murder (option E). However, there is no indication that people would get in trouble (option B) or go to prison (option D) just because of rumors.

818	When people are waiting for something, they may initially engage in activities such as reading a book or scrolling through their phone to pass the time. However, as time passes, they may start to feel bored or restless. They may also begin to worry about whether the thing they are waiting for will actually come or not. In some cases, the thing they are waiting for may never come, leading to disappointment or frustration. Singing may be a possible activity for some people while waiting, but it is not a universal response. Therefore, the correct answer would be a combination of A, B, C, and E.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.06611570247933884	0.10743801652892562	0.024793388429752067	0.049586776859504134	0.14049586776859505	0.09917355371900827	0.0	0.1322314049586777	0.049586776859504134	0.12396694214876033	0.0	0.0	121

Next, we need to consider which of these options would have lots of windows in a corner area. A. Wall - While a wall can have windows, it is not a corner area and therefore does not fit the criteria of the question. B. Office - An office can have windows in a corner area, but it depends on the specific layout and design of the office. C. Space shuttle - A space shuttle does not have corners or windows in the traditional sense, so this option can be eliminated. D.

820	First, it's important to remain calm and patient. Then, try to communicate with the person using nonverbal cues such as gestures or facial expressions. If the person knows sign language, that can also be helpful. It's important to avoid completing their sentences for them or speaking for them, as this can be frustrating and disempowering. Offering a comforting drink like tea may also help to soothe the person. Feeling angry or crossing the street are not helpful actions in this situation.

826	First, we need to find an armchair that is used by only a few people. This suggests that it is not a commonly used armchair, but rather one that is used in a specific setting or by a specific group of people. A. Doctor's office: While there may be armchairs in a doctor's office, they are likely to be used by many patients throughout the day, so it is unlikely that they would be used by only a few people. B. Hospital: Similar to a doctor's office, armchairs in a hospital are likely to be used by many patients and visitors, so it is unlikely that they would be used by only a few people. C. Apartment: This could be a possibility, as an armchair in a private apartment would likely only be used by the residents of that apartment. However, it is not a guarantee that the armchair would be used by only a few people, as it depends on the number of residents in the apartment. D. Study: This could also be a possibility, as an armchair in a study or home office would likely only be used by the person who works in that space. However, it is not a guarantee that the armchair would be used by only a few people, as it depends on the number of people who work in that space. E. Furniture store: This is unlikely, as armchairs in a furniture store are likely to be used by many customers who come in to test them out. Based on this analysis, the best answer would be either C. apartment or D. study, but it is not a guarantee that the armchair would be used by only a few people in those settings.	0.043343653250773995	0.0	0.0030959752321981426	0.058823529411764705	0.11455108359133127	0.021671826625386997	0.04953560371517028	0.17956656346749225	0.11764705882352941	0.0	0.07120743034055728	0.06191950464396285	0.09287925696594428	0.0	0.018575851393188854	323

831	The woman had been applying for jobs for weeks with no call back. This means that she was not getting any responses from potential employers. She knew she was qualified, which means she had the necessary skills and experience for the jobs she was applying for. Given this information, it is likely that the woman would feel frustrated. She is putting in effort to find a job, but is not seeing any results. This can be discouraging and disheartening. It is possible that she may also feel stressed, as the longer she goes without a job, the more financial pressure she may feel. However, the answer is not employment, working hard, or love, as these do not accurately reflect the emotions the woman is likely experiencing in this situation.

Therefore, the best answer is C, ""blowing hard."""	0.026490066225165563	0.0	0.026490066225165563	0.046357615894039736	0.052980132450331126	0.019867549668874173	0.059602649006622516	0.23841059602649006	0.039735099337748346	0.0	0.09271523178807947	0.046357615894039736	0.2185430463576159	0.0	0.006622516556291391	151
840	Dan outfitted his house to run on the oldest heat source on Earth. This means that the heat source has been around for a very long time. Option A, fire, has been used by humans for thousands of years, but it is not the oldest heat source on Earth. Option B, solar energy, has been around since the formation of the sun, which is over 4.6 billion years old. This makes it a strong contender for the oldest heat source on Earth. Option C, the sun, is the source of solar energy and is indeed one of the oldest heat sources on Earth. Option D, the house, is not a heat source. Option E, coal or wood, are both sources of heat that have been used by humans for a long time, but they are not the oldest heat source on Earth. Therefore, the answer is either B or C, but since the question asks for the oldest heat source on Earth, the answer is C, the sun.	0.03608247422680412	0.0	0.0	0.02577319587628866	0.08762886597938144	0.015463917525773196	0.02577319587628866	0.25257731958762886	0.10309278350515463	0.015463917525773196	0.03608247422680412	0.061855670103092786	0.13402061855670103	0.0	0.04639175257731959	194
841	First, we know that a horse is an animal. Second, we know that horses are domesticated animals, meaning they are kept by humans for various purposes. Third, we know that horses are large animals that require a lot of space to move around. Based on these facts, we can eliminate options A and E, as they are specific locations and do not necessarily provide the necessary space for a horse to live comfortably. Option C, a race track, is a possible location for a horse, but it is not where a horse would live permanently. Horses may stay at a race track temporarily for training and racing purposes, but they would need a more permanent home.That leaves us with options B and D. A stable is a common location for horses to live, especially if they are used for riding or other work. A farm yard is also a possible location for a horse to live, as many farms keep horses for various purposes such as plowing fields or pulling carts.Therefore, the most likely answer is either B. stable or D. farm yard.	0.01932367149758454	0.0	0.024154589371980676	0.05314009661835749	0.07729468599033816	0.024154589371980676	0.06280193236714976	0.21739130434782608	0.07729468599033816	0.0	0.10628019323671498	0.07246376811594203	0.10628019323671498	0.0	0.024154589371980676	207
842	"First, we need to understand who ""she"" refers to. Without any context, we cannot determine this. Assuming we have context and know who ""she"" is, we can then consider the options. A. Insane: This is a possibility, but it is not a fair assumption to make without more information. Singing a lot does not necessarily mean someone is insane. B. Annoy people around: This is also a possibility, but again, we cannot assume this without more information. It is possible that the people around her enjoy her singing. C. Enjoy: This is a likely possibility. If she sings a lot, it could be because she enjoys it. D. Inhale: This option does not make sense in this context. E. Had good voice: This is also a possibility. If she has a good voice, she may enjoy singing and want to share her talent with others. Therefore, the most likely answer is C.

843	"First, we need to identify the ""greatest of the Michigan's greats."" This phrase suggests that we are looking for a large body of water in Michigan. Option A, pond, is unlikely to be the correct answer as ponds are generally smaller bodies of water. Option B, underwater, does not make sense as it is not a body of water. Option C, aquarium, is also unlikely to be the correct answer as it is a man-made enclosure for aquatic life, not a natural body of water. Option D, Lake Superior, is a possibility as it is one of the largest lakes in the world and is located in Michigan. Option E, body of water, is too general to be a definitive answer.

844	The sentence mentions that the person is an adult but still sleeps on a sofa bed in his parent's place. This suggests that he doesn't have his own room or bed. Option A, garage, is unlikely as it is not a typical place for someone to sleep. Option B, horseradish, is completely unrelated and doesn't make sense in the context. Option C, living room, is a common area in a house where a sofa bed could be placed for guests or for someone who doesn't have their own room. This option seems plausible. Option D, guest room, is also a possibility, but the sentence specifically mentions a sofa bed, which is more commonly found in a living room. Option E, basement, is another possibility, but the sentence doesn't provide any indication that the person sleeps in the basement. Therefore, the most likely answer is C. living room.	0.011428571428571429	0.0	0.0	0.045714285714285714	0.09714285714285714	0.022857142857142857	0.045714285714285714	0.26285714285714284	0.05714285714285714	0.0	0.06285714285714286	0.045714285714285714	0.13142857142857142	0.0	0.005714285714285714	175
845	James wants to keep his clipboard where he can easily find it. This suggests that he needs to access it frequently. Option A: Shelf - While a shelf is a possible location, it may not be easily accessible if James needs to constantly reach for it. Option B: Place of work - This could be a good option if James has a designated workspace where he spends most of his time. Option C: Desk - This is a likely option as it is a common place to keep important documents and supplies within reach. Option D: Office supply store - This is not a feasible option as it is not a location where James would have constant access to his clipboard. Option E: School - This is not a relevant option unless James is a student or teacher and needs the clipboard for school-related tasks. Therefore, the most likely answer is C.

846	The mother was worried about spills, which suggests that she wanted to protect a surface from getting dirty or stained. Option A, Persia, doesn't make sense in this context as it is a region in Iran and not a surface in the house. Option B, table, is a possibility as spills often happen on tables. Option C, living room, is not a surface but a room in the house. Option D, house, is too broad and doesn't specify a particular surface. Option E, desk, is also a possibility as spills can happen on desks. Therefore, the most likely answer is B. table.

847	First, we know that the smell is coming from the kitchen. So, we can eliminate options A, B, D, and E as they are not related to the kitchen. That leaves us with option C, the cupboard. It is possible that there is something in the cupboard that is causing the stale smell. It could be old food, expired spices, or even mold. Checking the cupboard would be a good place to start in identifying the source of the smell.	0.02127659574468085	0.0	0.031914893617021274	0.09574468085106383	0.10638297872340426	0.02127659574468085	0.031914893617021274	0.18085106382978725	0.07446808510638298	0.0	0.10638297872340426	0.0425531914893617	0.14893617021276595	0.0	0.010638297872340425	94
848	First, we need to understand what in vitro fertilization (IVF) is. IVF is a medical procedure where an egg is fertilized with sperm outside of the body, in a laboratory dish. The fertilized egg (embryo) is then transferred to the woman's uterus to grow and develop.Now, let's look at the options:A. Problems: This is a vague option, but it could refer to a variety of fertility problems that may make it difficult or impossible for someone to conceive naturally. IVF can be a solution for some of these problems.B. Offspring: This is a general reason why someone might want to reproduce, but it doesn't specifically explain why they would choose IVF over other methods.C. Overpopulation: This is not a reason why someone would use IVF. In fact, some people choose IVF because they want to have a child without contributing to overpopulation.D. Larger family: Again, this is a general reason why someone might want to reproduce, but it doesn't specifically explain why they would choose IVF over other methods.E. Baby: This is another general reason why someone might want to reproduce, but it doesn't specifically explain why they would choose IVF over other methods.So, the most likely answer is A.

852	First, we need to consider where a janitor would typically keep their cleaning supplies. It's unlikely that they would keep them in a wishing well or a kitchen, as those are not typically associated with cleaning supplies. A hardware store is where one would go to purchase cleaning supplies, but it's not where the janitor would keep their pail. A garage is also an unlikely location, as it's typically associated with cars and storage, not cleaning supplies. Therefore, the most likely answer is E. utility room, as this is where janitors typically keep their cleaning supplies and equipment.	0.017699115044247787	0.0	0.008849557522123894	0.08849557522123894	0.10619469026548672	0.04424778761061947	0.07079646017699115	0.21238938053097345	0.05309734513274336	0.0	0.11504424778761062	0.02654867256637168	0.10619469026548672	0.0	0.008849557522123894	113

854	First, we need to consider what type of cloth it is. If it's kitchen towels or dishcloths, then option B (kitchen) would be the most appropriate place to put them. If it's bed linens or bath towels, then option A (linen closet) or option E (bedroom) would be the best choices. Option C (on the space heater) is not a safe option as it can be a fire hazard. Option D (fabric store) is not relevant as it's not a place to store personal cloth items. Therefore, the best answer would depend on the type of cloth and its intended use, but options A, B, or E would be the most likely choices.	0.007194244604316547	0.0	0.007194244604316547	0.06474820143884892	0.1079136690647482	0.014388489208633094	0.04316546762589928	0.2733812949640288	0.04316546762589928	0.0	0.050359712230215826	0.050359712230215826	0.16546762589928057	0.0	0.007194244604316547	139
855	First, we need to understand what listening vinyl is. It refers to vinyl records that are meant to be played on a turntable for listening purposes. Next, we need to consider where one can typically find vinyl records. Safeway is a grocery store chain and is unlikely to sell vinyl records. Record albums is not a physical location, but rather a general term for vinyl records. A record store, on the other hand, is a specialized store that sells vinyl records, CDs, and other music-related merchandise. Therefore, the most likely answer is C. record store. A car is not a place where one would typically purchase vinyl records, and wallpaper is not related to music at all.	0.029411764705882353	0.0	0.014705882352941176	0.058823529411764705	0.08823529411764706	0.014705882352941176	0.0661764705882353	0.2647058823529412	0.04411764705882353	0.0	0.11029411764705882	0.051470588235294115	0.1323529411764706	0.0	0.022058823529411766	136

Therefore, we can eliminate options A, B, and E as they do not involve the ability to read. Next, we need to consider how the robot acquired the books. Option C suggests that it bought the books, but there is no information in the sentence to support this. Therefore, we can eliminate option C. This leaves us with option D, which states that the robot learned to read. This is the most logical answer as it explains how the robot was able to read the books without any external assistance.

863	A binder is a school or office supply item used to hold papers and documents together. Therefore, the most likely place to buy a binder would be an office supply store, such as Staples, Office Depot, or Walmart. Option E is the correct answer.

864	First, we need to understand what a connection is in this context. In travel, a connection usually refers to a flight that a passenger needs to take in order to reach their final destination. So, if James was delayed because of a connection, it means that he had to take another flight to reach his final destination, and that flight was delayed. Therefore, the most likely answer is B. airport, as that is where James would have had to catch his connecting flight. The other options (company, wall, computer network, love) do not make sense in this context.	0.05217391304347826	0.0	0.008695652173913044	0.06956521739130435	0.08695652173913043	0.034782608695652174	0.043478260869565216	0.19130434782608696	0.06086956521739131	0.0	0.12173913043478261	0.034782608695652174	0.14782608695652175	0.0	0.034782608695652174	115
865	Isopropyl alcohol is a chemical compound commonly used as a disinfectant and solvent. It is not typically found in places like pubs, restaurants, or parks. Therefore, options A, B, and C can be eliminated. Isopropyl alcohol can be found in some supermarkets, but it is usually located in the cleaning or first aid section. However, safety glasses are not typically sold in supermarkets. The most likely place to find both isopropyl alcohol and safety glasses is in a chemistry lab.

866	First, the man tried to run but he could not. This means that he was unable to move quickly. Next, the question asks what he could do to move. The answer choices are: stand, go quickly, walking, stand still, and walk slowly. We can eliminate options A and D (stand and stand still) because they suggest that the man is not moving at all. Option B (go quickly) is the opposite of what the sentence tells us - the man could not run, so he cannot go quickly. Option E (walk slowly) is also unlikely because it suggests that the man is able to move, but at a slow pace. This leaves us with option C (walking) as the most likely answer. The sentence tells us that the man could not run, but it does not say that he could not walk. Therefore, we can assume that the man could only move by walking. So the answer is C, walking.	0.010416666666666666	0.0	0.020833333333333332	0.07291666666666667	0.09375	0.046875	0.08854166666666667	0.125	0.026041666666666668	0.0	0.16666666666666666	0.026041666666666668	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.005208333333333333	192

869	First, we need a place where we can get in shape. The options are fridge, limejuice, square, gym, and refrigerator. Out of these options, only the gym is a place where we can work out and get in shape.Next, we need a place where we can drink at a juice bar. The options are the same as before. However, only limejuice and square could potentially have a juice bar, but it's not clear from the options.Therefore, the answer is D. gym. While it's not explicitly stated that the gym has a juice bar, many gyms do have juice bars or smoothie bars where you can grab a healthy drink after your workout.	0.007407407407407408	0.0	0.037037037037037035	0.06666666666666667	0.1111111111111111	0.044444444444444446	0.06666666666666667	0.23703703703703705	0.06666666666666667	0.0	0.05925925925925926	0.037037037037037035	0.14074074074074075	0.0	0.014814814814814815	135
870	First, we need to identify the purpose of the meeting. Is it for work, socializing, or a specific activity? Once we have determined the purpose, we can then consider different ways for people to meet with each other. For work-related meetings, options could include video conferencing, in-person meetings, or phone calls. For socializing, people could meet up at a restaurant, park, or someone's home. For specific activities, people could join a club or group that shares their interests, attend events or classes, or participate in online forums or communities. Therefore, the answer is C. group together.	0.01639344262295082	0.0	0.02459016393442623	0.05737704918032787	0.05737704918032787	0.00819672131147541	0.03278688524590164	0.27049180327868855	0.09016393442622951	0.0	0.09836065573770492	0.040983606557377046	0.1885245901639344	0.0	0.01639344262295082	122
871	Horses need energy to move and perform various activities. The most common way for horses to get energy is by eating grass or hay. Grass and hay are rich in carbohydrates, which are broken down into glucose and used by the horse's body as fuel. Horses also need water to stay hydrated and maintain their energy levels. Playing and exercise can help horses burn off excess energy, but they do not directly provide energy. Keeping horses in stables does not provide them with energy either. Dominance is a social behavior and does not relate to energy. Finally, horses cannot drink coffee as it is harmful to their health. Therefore, the correct answer is A. eat grass.	0.015267175572519083	0.0	0.0	0.03816793893129771	0.08396946564885496	0.0	0.04580152671755725	0.2748091603053435	0.09923664122137404	0.0	0.1297709923664122	0.061068702290076333	0.09923664122137404	0.0	0.015267175572519083	131
872	First, we need to identify the purpose of the line. People standing on a line near a road are most likely waiting for something related to transportation. A. Water fountain - It is unlikely that people would be standing on a line near a water fountain, as there is no need to wait in line to use a water fountain. B. Military base - While there may be lines at a military base, they would likely be for security or administrative purposes, not related to transportation. C. Apartment - There may be lines for things like package delivery or building access, but again, not related to transportation. D. Fire house - People may line up to receive assistance from firefighters, but this would not be near a road and not related to transportation. E. Bus stop - This is the most likely answer. People often stand in line at bus stops, waiting for a bus to arrive and take them to their destination. Therefore, the answer is E. Bus stop.	0.02127659574468085	0.0	0.005319148936170213	0.047872340425531915	0.0851063829787234	0.010638297872340425	0.03723404255319149	0.23404255319148937	0.12234042553191489	0.0	0.09574468085106383	0.031914893617021274	0.12234042553191489	0.0	0.015957446808510637	188
873	First, we need to identify where koalas are typically found in the wild. Koalas are native to Australia, specifically in eucalyptus forests. Next, we need to identify where pandas are typically found in the wild. Pandas are native to China, specifically in bamboo forests. Based on this information, we can eliminate options D and E. Option A, jungle, is too broad and could refer to many different types of animals and habitats. Option B, bamboo grove, is more specific and could be a possible location for a panda display, but not necessarily for a koala display. Option C, Australian outback, is the most likely answer as it is the closest match to the natural habitat of a koala. Therefore, the answer is C. Australian outback.	0.02054794520547945	0.0	0.02054794520547945	0.0273972602739726	0.08904109589041095	0.0136986301369863	0.07534246575342465	0.2191780821917808	0.0958904109589041	0.0	0.06164383561643835	0.0821917808219178	0.14383561643835616	0.0	0.0547945205479452	146
874	Exercising immediately leads to using energy. This is because when we exercise, our body requires energy to perform the physical activity. However, after exercising, the answer may vary depending on the individual and the type of exercise. Some people may feel relaxed after exercising, while others may feel energized or exhausted.

875	"The person finds relaxation by simply opening one up. This means that they are opening something, but what? Option A, ""more rice,"" doesn't make sense in this context. Option B, ""own house,"" could be a possibility if the person finds relaxation by opening up their own house, perhaps by letting in fresh air or sunlight. However, there is not enough information to confirm this as the correct answer. Option C, ""warm coat,"" also doesn't make sense in this context. Option D, ""light up,"" could refer to lighting a candle or turning on a lamp, which could create a relaxing atmosphere. However, this is not the most likely answer. Option E, ""read book,"" seems like the most likely answer. Opening up a book can be a way to relax and escape into a different world.

876	First, a person does something to hurt someone else. This means they have caused harm or pain to another person. Next, we need to consider what the person might do in response to this action. Option A, feel sorry, seems like a likely response. If someone realizes they have hurt someone else, they may feel remorseful and wish to apologize or make amends. Option B, trust god, does not seem directly related to the situation. While a person's faith may influence their actions, it is not a specific response to causing harm to someone else. Option C, cross street, also does not seem related to the situation. This action would be more appropriate if someone was trying to avoid a potential danger or conflict, rather than responding to causing harm to someone else. Option D, ride a bike, is also not related to the situation. Option E, lend money, is also not directly related to causing harm to someone else. While a person may choose to lend money as a way to make amends or show kindness, it is not a specific response to causing harm. Therefore, the most likely answer is A, feel sorry.	0.030837004405286344	0.0	0.004405286343612335	0.07048458149779736	0.07929515418502203	0.01762114537444934	0.07048458149779736	0.1762114537444934	0.07048458149779736	0.0	0.14977973568281938	0.039647577092511016	0.13656387665198239	0.0	0.00881057268722467	227

878	The food item should be small enough to fit in your hand. So, we can eliminate options A and C as they are not food items that can fit in your hand. Option B, chocolate, can have varying amounts of sugar depending on the type and brand. Some dark chocolates may have less sugar than milk chocolates. Option D, candy bar, is a likely candidate as most candy bars are small enough to fit in your hand and are known to have high amounts of sugar. Option E, soda pop, is also a likely candidate as a can of soda can fit in your hand and is known to have high amounts of sugar.

Next, we need to consider the context of the question, which is waiting for a meeting. This means that the reception area is likely located in a place where meetings are held. Based on these clues, the most likely answer is E. office building. Reception areas are commonly found in office buildings, and it is common practice to wait in the reception area before a meeting. A. hall, B. motel, and C. hotels are less likely options as they are not typically associated with meeting spaces. D. law firm is a possibility, but it is more specific than the general answer of an office building.	0.05228758169934641	0.0	0.013071895424836602	0.05228758169934641	0.08496732026143791	0.0196078431372549	0.05228758169934641	0.26143790849673204	0.0915032679738562	0.0	0.10457516339869281	0.032679738562091505	0.10457516339869281	0.0	0.026143790849673203	153

Option C, music, is important for dancing, but it is not a basic skill that the instructor would need to teach her. Option E, having fun, is important for enjoying dancing, but it is not a basic skill that the instructor would need to teach her. Option B, rhythmic movement, is a basic skill related to dancing. It involves moving the body in time with the music and keeping a steady beat. This is likely the skill that the instructor taught her to improve her dancing ability. Option D, moving body, is too general and does not specify a particular skill related to dancing.

So, if a student is about to graduate, it means they have completed their course of study. Now, let's look at the options. A) Library - a student can still go to the library even after graduation, so this is not the correct answer. B) Parties - graduation parties are common, but this is not the correct answer. C) Kindergarten class - if a student is about to graduate, it means they have completed a higher level of education than kindergarten, so this is not the correct answer. D) Bar - this is not relevant to the question. E) School - if a student is about to graduate, it means they will no longer be attending school, so this is the correct answer. Therefore, the answer is E) school.	0.011111111111111112	0.0	0.005555555555555556	0.06111111111111111	0.08333333333333333	0.016666666666666666	0.044444444444444446	0.18333333333333332	0.044444444444444446	0.0	0.10555555555555556	0.05555555555555555	0.17777777777777778	0.005555555555555556	0.011111111111111112	180

It is typically used by businesses or individuals to monitor their financial activities.Next, we need to consider the scenario presented in the question. The question states that the person is leaving and does not need to bring the account book with them. This suggests that the person will not be using the account book in the near future.Given these considerations, the best answer would be A. kept at accountant. This means that the account book would be left with a professional accountant who can continue to monitor the person's financial activities and keep the account book up to date. This would be a safe and secure way to ensure that the person's financial records are properly maintained even if they are not personally using the account book.	0.04093567251461988	0.0	0.011695906432748537	0.04093567251461988	0.08771929824561403	0.029239766081871343	0.03508771929824561	0.22807017543859648	0.06432748538011696	0.0	0.14619883040935672	0.05847953216374269	0.07602339181286549	0.0	0.011695906432748537	171

This new freedom can open up new opportunities and experiences in your life that were previously blocked by your negative emotions. Additionally, forgiving others can also lead to a sense of inner peace and contentment, which can positively impact your mental and emotional well-being.	0.024193548387096774	0.0	0.0	0.12903225806451613	0.07258064516129033	0.024193548387096774	0.04032258064516129	0.18548387096774194	0.11290322580645161	0.0	0.12903225806451613	0.07258064516129033	0.10483870967741936	0.0	0.008064516129032258	124
925	The question is asking about a stat that is kept track of during baseball games. The options given are happiness, sore muscles, injury, perfection, and errors. Happiness, sore muscles, and injury are not stats that are typically kept track of during baseball games. Perfection could be a stat that is kept track of, but it is not the most common one. The correct answer is E. Errors. In baseball, an error is a defensive misplay that allows a batter or baserunner to advance one or more bases or allows a batter to reach base when they should have been put out. Errors are recorded in the scorebook and can affect a player's fielding percentage.	0.05384615384615385	0.0	0.0	0.046153846153846156	0.12307692307692308	0.007692307692307693	0.015384615384615385	0.2692307692307692	0.06923076923076923	0.007692307692307693	0.1	0.046153846153846156	0.11538461538461539	0.0	0.015384615384615385	130
926	First, someone needs to have an interest in creating art. This could stem from a desire to express themselves, a love for aesthetics, or a curiosity about the creative process. Next, they may need to gather materials or tools depending on the type of art they want to create. For example, a painter would need paint, brushes, and canvas, while a sculptor would need clay or other materials to mold. Then, they may need to find a space to work in, whether it be a studio, a corner of their home, or even outside. Finally, they need to begin experimenting and practicing their craft. This may involve taking classes, watching tutorials, or simply diving in and creating something. So, the answer would be a combination of A, C, and D - relaxing, finding pleasure in the process, and potentially experiencing frustration as they learn and grow as an artist. E, needing theater, is not necessarily a requirement for creating art.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.05759162303664921	0.05235602094240838	0.010471204188481676	0.05235602094240838	0.19895287958115182	0.08376963350785341	0.0	0.15706806282722513	0.015706806282722512	0.16753926701570682	0.0	0.005235602094240838	191
927	First, consider the number of people attending. If it's a large reception with many guests, a small restaurant or lobby may not be suitable. Next, think about the atmosphere you want to create. A grand casino or country club may be too formal for a casual gathering, while a lobby may not provide enough privacy. Therefore, the best option would be a large room, such as a banquet hall or event space, that can accommodate a large number of guests and can be decorated to fit the desired atmosphere.	0.0196078431372549	0.0	0.0	0.029411764705882353	0.10784313725490197	0.0196078431372549	0.0392156862745098	0.21568627450980393	0.058823529411764705	0.0	0.09803921568627451	0.11764705882352941	0.11764705882352941	0.0	0.00980392156862745	102
928	First, try to see if the ink in the pen has run out. If so, replace the ink cartridge or refill the pen with ink. If the ink is not the issue, check to see if the cap is securely on the pen. If the cap is not on, the pen may have dried out. If the cap is on, try scribbling on a piece of paper to see if the pen starts working again. If none of these solutions work, it may be time to replace the pen. So, the answer would be a combination of A, B, C, and E.	0.01694915254237288	0.0	0.0	0.00847457627118644	0.09322033898305085	0.06779661016949153	0.059322033898305086	0.19491525423728814	0.07627118644067797	0.0	0.11864406779661017	0.0	0.13559322033898305	0.0	0.00847457627118644	118
929	First, someone has to come up with the idea for the building and decide what it will be used for. This could be a developer, a business owner, or a government agency. Next, an architect is typically hired to design the building. The architect will work with the client to understand their needs and preferences, and then create a set of plans and drawings that show what the building will look like and how it will be constructed. Once the plans are finalized, builders and tradesmen are hired to actually construct the building according to the architect's specifications. So, the answer is C. architect.	0.0423728813559322	0.0	0.0	0.059322033898305086	0.11016949152542373	0.01694915254237288	0.05084745762711865	0.211864406779661	0.06779661016949153	0.0	0.1271186440677966	0.0	0.11016949152542373	0.0	0.01694915254237288	118
930	A bay is a body of water that is partially enclosed by land. Therefore, it cannot be found in a lake (option A). Manhattan (option B) and Los Angeles (option E) are specific cities and not relevant to the question. A bay is typically found along a shoreline (option C), but not always. The correct answer is D.

931	"The question mentions ""traveling along liquid."" This suggests that people are on some kind of watercraft or vessel. A. Sail boats are a type of watercraft that use wind power to move across the water. This could be a possible answer. B. Questioning authority is not necessarily related to traveling on liquid, so this is unlikely to be the answer. C. High fives are a physical gesture of celebration or congratulations, but they don't have anything to do with traveling on liquid. D. Sharing things could be a possible activity that people engage in while traveling on liquid, but it's not specific enough to be the answer. E. Learning from each other could also be a possible activity that people engage in while traveling on liquid, but it's not specific enough to be the answer.

933	The man on the street corner was showing off a wristwatch. This suggests that he wants people to see it and perhaps admire it. However, the second part of the sentence suggests that he is trying to use it for drug money. This means that he is likely trying to sell or trade the watch for drugs. Option A, jewelry store, is unlikely because a jewelry store would not typically buy a single wristwatch from a random person on the street. Option B, case, does not make sense in this context. Option C, hock, is a possibility because it means to pawn or sell something for quick cash. Option D, watch store, is unlikely because a watch store would not typically buy a used watch from a random person on the street. Option E, pawn, is the most likely answer because it means to give something as security for a loan, which is a common way for people to get quick cash for items they own. In this case, the man may be trying to pawn the watch in exchange for money to buy drugs. Therefore, the answer is E. pawn.	0.004629629629629629	0.0	0.0	0.05092592592592592	0.06481481481481481	0.032407407407407406	0.027777777777777776	0.24537037037037038	0.08333333333333333	0.0	0.12037037037037036	0.05555555555555555	0.11574074074074074	0.0	0.004629629629629629	216
934	The man needed to buy flooring, so he would most likely look for it in a store that sells home improvement materials. Option A, Walmart, is a possibility, but they may not have a large selection of flooring options. Option B, loft, does not make sense as lofts are typically living spaces and not stores. Option C, house, also does not make sense as a house is a place to live, not a store. Option D, Home Depot, is a popular home improvement store that sells flooring, so this is the most likely answer. Option E, kitchen, is not a store and does not make sense in this context. Therefore, the answer is D.

935	First, Bill was awaking, which means he was transitioning from a state of sleep to wakefulness. This suggests that his brain activity was increasing, and his body was preparing to become active. Next, the question asks about what was happening to him physiologically. Physiological refers to the functions and processes of the body, so we can eliminate options D and E, which refer to actions that Bill might take after waking up. Option A, tiredness, doesn't make sense because Bill is waking up, so he wouldn't be feeling tired at that moment. Option C, discomfort, is possible, but there's no indication in the question that Bill is experiencing any discomfort. That leaves us with option B, grogginess. Grogginess is a common feeling upon waking up, and it's caused by a combination of factors such as sleep inertia, low blood pressure, and decreased brain activity. So, the most likely physiological state that Bill is experiencing upon waking up is grogginess. Therefore, the answer is B.	0.035897435897435895	0.0	0.010256410256410256	0.06153846153846154	0.09743589743589744	0.03076923076923077	0.035897435897435895	0.18974358974358974	0.09743589743589744	0.0	0.12307692307692308	0.046153846153846156	0.13846153846153847	0.0	0.035897435897435895	195

937	"First, we need to determine what ""base"" refers to in this context. It could be a military base, a radio station, or a home base for a team or group. Assuming we are talking about a home base for a team or group, the answer would likely be a handheld or mobile radio. These radios operate on specific frequencies and can communicate with other radios on the same frequency within a certain range.

Run away - This is a possibility. Wild animals may feel threatened or scared and run away if someone touches them. C. Bite - This is a common danger of touching wild animals. They may feel threatened or territorial and bite in self-defense. D. Keep alive - This is not a relevant outcome. Touching wild animals does not affect their ability to stay alive. E.

940	The statement says that Danny hated helping people. This means that he did not enjoy it. The next part of the statement says that it always brought something. This means that there was a consequence or result of his actions. Option A, satisfaction, and option B, good feelings, are positive outcomes. Since Danny hated helping people, it is unlikely that he would feel satisfied or have good feelings from it. Option D, feel good about yourself, is similar to options A and B. It is a positive outcome that Danny would not experience since he hated helping people. Option E, stress, is a negative outcome that is more likely to be associated with something that someone hates doing. This leaves us with option C, complications. Helping people can often lead to complications, such as misunderstandings, disagreements, or unexpected problems. This is a more neutral outcome that could be associated with someone who hates helping people. Therefore, the answer is C. complications.	0.0427807486631016	0.0	0.0053475935828877	0.10695187165775401	0.09090909090909091	0.0427807486631016	0.026737967914438502	0.18716577540106952	0.053475935828877004	0.0	0.12834224598930483	0.0748663101604278	0.13903743315508021	0.0	0.0213903743315508	187
941	The person wants to make more at their job but can't. This means that they are currently not earning enough money at their current job. Therefore, they need to find a solution to increase their income. Option A, owning a house, is not relevant to the situation. Option C, winning the lottery, is not a reliable or realistic solution. Option D, saving money, may help the person in the long run, but it does not address the immediate need for more income. Option E, feeling safe, is also not relevant to the situation. This leaves us with option B, finding a better job. This is the most logical and practical solution for someone who wants to make more money at their job but is unable to do so. By finding a better job with higher pay, the person can increase their income and improve their financial situation.

Option B, front door, does not make sense as it is not a location where people would typically read newspapers while commuting. Option C, lawn, also does not make sense as it is an outdoor location and not a place where people would typically read newspapers while commuting. Option D, bookstore, is also unlikely as people are usually in a rush to get to work and would not stop at a bookstore to read a newspaper.

Option A: Classroom - This could be a possibility if the student left the instrument on a desk or table in the classroom. Option B: Desk drawer - This could also be a possibility if the student had a desk or drawer in the classroom where he left the instrument. Option C: Bathroom - It is unlikely that the student left his writing instrument in the bathroom unless he was using it to write something while in there. Option D: Pocket - If the student had the instrument in his pocket, he would have realized that he still had it with him. Option E: Stationery store - This is not a possibility as the student left the instrument at his last place of study, not at a store.

991	First, consider the purpose of a fire extinguisher - it is used to put out fires. Therefore, it should be easily accessible in case of an emergency. Option A (school bus) and Option E (hospital) are not relevant as they are not locations within a house. Option B (car) is also not ideal as it is not easily accessible within the house. Option C (garage) could be a good option if the garage is attached to the house and easily accessible. However, if the fire is inside the house, it may be difficult to reach the garage. Option D (stairwell) is a good option as it is a central location within the house and easily accessible from multiple rooms. However, it is important to ensure that the fire extinguisher does not block the stairwell or become a tripping hazard. Therefore, the best answer is D.

993	First, we need to assume that the automobile is on a road. Option A, driving on the side of the road, is not a viable option as it is illegal and dangerous. Option B, driving in a parking garage, would not get the automobile to its destination quicker as it is not a direct route. Option C, driving on the street, is the most likely option as it is the main route for automobiles to get to their destination. Option D, driving into a garage, would only be applicable if the destination is a specific building or location with a garage. Option E, driving in the fast lane, could be a viable option if the automobile is on a highway or freeway and needs to get to its destination quickly. However, it is important to note that the fast lane is not always the quickest option as it can be congested with traffic.

995	Wild cats are not typically found in trouble or a dog's mouth, so we can eliminate options A and B. They are often found in nature, so option C is a possibility. However, they can also be found in urban areas, so option D (floor) is not specific enough. Option E (warm place) is also not specific enough, as wild cats can be found in a variety of environments.

997	If you did not finish what you got, it means you have some items left over. Therefore, you would only need a shopping bag if you were leaving a place where you purchased items. A. A mart could be a general store or a department store, so it's possible that you could need a shopping bag if you didn't finish your shopping there. B. A restaurant is a place where you eat food, so you wouldn't need a shopping bag there. C. If you're at a relative's home, you wouldn't need a shopping bag unless you brought items with you that you didn't use. D. A supermarket is a place where you buy groceries, so it's likely that you would need a shopping bag if you didn't finish your shopping there. E.

998	Killing is the act of taking someone's life, which is generally considered a horrible and tragic event. It can also be seen as premeditated if it was planned in advance. Remorse may be felt by the person who committed the act or by those affected by it. Going to jail may be a consequence of killing if it is deemed a criminal act. However, killing is not usually thought of as a funeral, as a funeral is a ceremony to honor and remember the deceased. Therefore, the answer is not A, but rather a combination of B, D, and potentially E depending on the circumstances.	0.08403361344537816	0.0	0.0	0.05042016806722689	0.1092436974789916	0.01680672268907563	0.058823529411764705	0.15966386554621848	0.1092436974789916	0.0	0.13445378151260504	0.03361344537815126	0.1092436974789916	0.0	0.0	119

1002	"First, we need to understand what ""over indulgent"" means. It refers to someone who excessively indulges in something, such as food, alcohol, or other pleasures. Next, we need to consider the context of the question. Punishment for over indulgence could vary depending on the situation. For example, if someone is over indulgent with food and becomes obese, the punishment could be health problems or social stigma. If someone is over indulgent with alcohol and causes harm to themselves or others, the punishment could be legal consequences or social ostracism. Given these factors, it's difficult to give a definitive answer to the question. However, based on the language used in the answer choices, it seems that the punishment for over indulgence is generally seen as negative and restrictive. Therefore, options A, B, C, and D (severe, harsh, hard, and strict) could all be possible answers. Option E (self denying) is not a punishment, but rather a behavior that someone might adopt in order to avoid over indulgence in the future."	0.01951219512195122	0.0	0.00975609756097561	0.06829268292682927	0.06341463414634146	0.014634146341463415	0.03414634146341464	0.2048780487804878	0.11219512195121951	0.0	0.08780487804878048	0.07804878048780488	0.17073170731707318	0.0	0.004878048780487805	205

Option B, ""eat cake,"" doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence. Option C, ""benign bacteria,"" is a possible explanation for why some cheeses are aged, but it doesn't directly relate to the man's love for cheese.

1011	The class was billed as a way to improve yourself, so it's likely that the instructor would lead the students in some kind of self-improvement activity. The instructor told everybody to close their eyes, which suggests that the activity involves some kind of introspection or focus. Option A, meditate, fits this description perfectly. Meditating involves closing your eyes and focusing your attention inward, which can be a powerful tool for self-improvement. Option B, celebrate, doesn't really make sense in this context. Celebrating what? Option C, plot the teacher's destruction, is clearly a joke answer and not a serious possibility. Option D, eat better, doesn't really fit with the idea of closing your eyes and improving yourself. Option E, feel better about yourself, is a possibility, but it's not as specific as meditating.

1013	Blowfish are aquatic animals, so options A and B can be eliminated. Option C may not be ideal for a blowfish as it would be in a stressful environment. Option D, a coral reef, could be a suitable location for a blowfish as it provides a natural habitat with plenty of hiding places and food sources.

While footprints could potentially be left on a roof, it is less likely and not a common occurrence. Therefore, option E can also be eliminated. This leaves us with options B and C. Footprints can be left on a carpet or rug, but they can also be easily removed with cleaning. On the other hand, footprints left on the ground are more permanent and can be used to track someone's movements. Therefore, the most likely answer is C, ground.	0.072	0.0	0.008	0.04	0.144	0.008	0.088	0.176	0.072	0.0	0.088	0.048	0.136	0.0	0.0	125

1017	First, we need to identify a place that has tens of millions of back gardens. This rules out options D and E, as cities and land do not typically have back gardens. Next, we need to consider which option has a large number of houses with back gardens. While all of the options could potentially have houses with back gardens, option C (house) is too specific and does not account for the large number of back gardens mentioned in the question. This leaves us with options A (England) and B (suburban neighborhood). While England certainly has a large number of houses with back gardens, it is not necessarily true that every house in England has a back garden. On the other hand, a suburban neighborhood is specifically designed to have houses with back gardens, making option B the most likely answer.

Option A, ""losing money,"" implies that the investor was not able to generate profit and may have incurred losses instead. This could be a possible answer. Option B, ""lost,"" is in the past tense and does not provide enough context to determine if the investor had lost money or something else. Option C, ""losses,"" is a noun and does not provide information on whether the investor had incurred losses or not. Option D, ""expense,"" does not relate to the investor's promise of profit and is not a suitable answer.

1038	"The sentence states that he retired from his command after twenty years, which means he had been in a position of authority for a long time. The sentence also mentions that he was proud of his choice, which suggests that he made a deliberate decision to do something. Finally, the sentence says that he was ready to retire, indicating that he had reached a point where he no longer wanted to continue in his role.Given these clues, we can eliminate options B, D, and E, as they all suggest a passive or subservient attitude, which doesn't fit with the idea of someone in a leadership position who is proud of their choices. Option A, ""obey,"" is also unlikely, as it implies that he was simply following orders rather than making his own decisions.That leaves us with option C, ""serve,"" which is the best fit for someone who is proud of their leadership role but also recognizes when it's time to step down and allow someone else to take over.

1040	First, we need to consider where an empty dish would typically be used. It is most commonly used for serving food, so it would likely be found on a table or in a kitchen. Next, we need to think about where an empty dish would be stored when it is not in use. It would not be stored in a restaurant, as that is a place of business and the dishes would be constantly in use. It could potentially be stored in a pantry, but that would depend on the individual's storage preferences and the size of their pantry. It is most likely to be stored in a kitchen cabinet, as that is where dishes are typically kept when not in use. Therefore, the correct answer is D. kitchen cabinet.	0.05517241379310345	0.0	0.013793103448275862	0.06206896551724138	0.14482758620689656	0.041379310344827586	0.07586206896551724	0.16551724137931034	0.10344827586206896	0.0	0.09655172413793103	0.027586206896551724	0.09655172413793103	0.0	0.013793103448275862	145

Option C, conversation, is a possibility, but it is too general and could apply to any situation involving two people. Option D, depression, is unlikely as it is not a desirable state to have before returning to work. Option E, fight, is also unlikely as it implies conflict between the two people, which is not necessary for the scenario. Therefore, the most likely answer is A, anxiety.

1081	First, we know that the realtor had a hard time selling the houses. This means that there was something about the houses that made them difficult to sell. Next, we know that the realtor had to explain something about the former tenant. This suggests that the difficulty in selling the houses was related to the previous occupant. Finally, we are given a list of options: pornography, park, very large, foundation, and walls. We need to choose the option that best fits with the information we have so far. Option A, pornography, seems unlikely as it is not typically something that would be associated with a former tenant in a house. Option B, park, also seems unlikely as it is not clear how a park would be relevant to the difficulty in selling the houses. Option C, very large, could potentially be relevant if the former tenant had left behind large items that were difficult to remove or caused damage to the property. Option D, foundation, could also be relevant if the former tenant had caused damage to the foundation of the house. Option E, walls, seems like the most likely option as it is common for former tenants to leave behind damage to the walls of a house, whether through holes, graffiti, or other means. Therefore, the answer is E. walls.	0.054901960784313725	0.0	0.0196078431372549	0.06666666666666667	0.08235294117647059	0.03137254901960784	0.050980392156862744	0.18823529411764706	0.09019607843137255	0.0	0.09411764705882353	0.08627450980392157	0.13333333333333333	0.0	0.00784313725490196	255

The options ""phone book,"" ""Mexico,"" ""a holiday,"" and ""city"" are all quite broad and don't provide much information. However, the option ""town"" stands out as a more specific location.Therefore, the answer is B. town.

1084	Locking your knees means keeping them straight and not bending them. When you stand in line, your muscles are working to keep you upright and balanced. If you lock your knees, you are putting extra strain on those muscles, which can cause them to fatigue more quickly. This can lead to a decrease in blood flow to the brain, which can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and even fainting. Therefore, the correct answer is D. fainting.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.11627906976744186	0.06976744186046512	0.023255813953488372	0.05813953488372093	0.1744186046511628	0.05813953488372093	0.0	0.1511627906976744	0.046511627906976744	0.13953488372093023	0.0	0.011627906976744186	86

Option B, beach sand, may have crabs, but it is not the best place to look for them. Option C, tidepools, are a great place to look for crabs as they are often found in these shallow pools during low tide. Option D, Chesapeake Bay, is also a great place to look for crabs as it is known for its blue crabs. Option E, fish market, is not a location to look for crabs, but rather a place to buy them after they have been caught. Therefore, the best answer is C. tidepools or D.

1086	First, we know that the setting is a trade show. This means that it is an event where companies and businesses showcase their products or services to potential customers or clients. Next, we need to consider what a spectator would be doing at a trade show. Unlike a sporting event or racing, where the focus is on competition and physical activity, a trade show is more about showcasing and demonstrating products. Therefore, the most likely answer is C. demonstration. As a spectator at a trade show, you would be watching demonstrations of various products and services, learning about their features and benefits, and potentially interacting with representatives from the companies. D. show is also a possible answer, as trade shows can be considered a type of show or exhibition. However, the focus is more on the products and services being showcased rather than on entertainment or performance. E. watch event is not a common phrase and does not accurately describe what a spectator would be doing at a trade show.	0.010582010582010581	0.0	0.010582010582010581	0.042328042328042326	0.09523809523809523	0.021164021164021163	0.0582010582010582	0.2804232804232804	0.08994708994708994	0.0	0.07407407407407407	0.031746031746031744	0.10052910052910052	0.0	0.010582010582010581	189
1087	The party animals started drinking in the evening, which means it was already dark outside. Option A, afternoon, can be eliminated because it's too early in the day. Option B, dusk, is a possibility, but it implies that the party ended shortly after the sun went down, which may not be the case. Option C, daytime, can also be eliminated because it contradicts the fact that they started drinking in the evening. Option D, night, is the most likely answer because it encompasses the time period between evening and dawn. Option E, dawn, is too late in the day and implies that the party lasted all night and into the morning, which may or may not be the case. Therefore, the answer is D. night.	0.05405405405405406	0.0	0.0	0.04054054054054054	0.10135135135135136	0.04054054054054054	0.06756756756756757	0.22297297297297297	0.0472972972972973	0.0	0.0945945945945946	0.02027027027027027	0.14864864864864866	0.0	0.060810810810810814	148
1088	The sentence states that getting up early was new for her, which implies that she was not used to waking up early. Therefore, it is likely that she experienced some discomfort or difficulty in adjusting to this new routine. The sentence also mentions that she needed some drops to clear up something. This suggests that she had some physical symptom that required treatment. Option A, restlessness, could be a possible symptom of difficulty adjusting to a new routine, but it does not explain why she needed drops. Option B, starting early, is not a symptom but rather the cause of her discomfort. Option C, tiredness, is a common symptom of sleep deprivation, which could be a result of waking up early. However, it does not explain why she needed drops. Option D, feeling tired, is similar to option C and does not provide a clear explanation for why she needed drops. Option E, bloodshot eyes, is a physical symptom that could be caused by a variety of factors, including lack of sleep, allergies, or eye strain. If she needed drops to clear up her bloodshot eyes, it suggests that this was the symptom that required treatment.

So, a person who is successful at bringing people to the table is likely someone who is skilled at facilitating communication and collaboration among different individuals or groups. Out of the given options, the closest answer would be B. compliments. While compliments alone may not be enough to bring people to the table, they can certainly help create a positive and welcoming atmosphere that encourages people to participate.

The cowboy was having fun atop the bull even though it was a wild ride."	0.06666666666666667	0.0	0.009523809523809525	0.06666666666666667	0.09523809523809523	0.01904761904761905	0.01904761904761905	0.2	0.05714285714285714	0.0	0.11428571428571428	0.0380952380952381	0.21904761904761905	0.0	0.009523809523809525	105
1098	"First, we need to identify the ride being referred to. The question does not provide any specific information about the ride, so we need to rely on our knowledge of Disney theme parks. One ride that immediately comes to mind is ""It's a Small World,"" which features animatronic dolls representing different cultures and countries singing the famous song ""It's a Small World After All."" Next, we need to determine what the ride is dedicated to getting to the world. The lyrics of the song provide a clue: ""It's a world of laughter, a world of tears It's a world of hopes, and a world of fears There's so much that we share, that it's time we're aware It's a small world after all"" Based on this, we can conclude that the answer is D. joy. The ride is dedicated to spreading joy and promoting unity and understanding among people from different parts of the world."	0.021739130434782608	0.0	0.03804347826086957	0.08695652173913043	0.08152173913043478	0.016304347826086956	0.03804347826086957	0.20108695652173914	0.10326086956521739	0.005434782608695652	0.11413043478260869	0.05434782608695652	0.11413043478260869	0.0	0.021739130434782608	184
1099	First, we need to identify the body part mentioned in the question. The question asks about the upper body, so we can eliminate options C, D, and E as they are not part of the upper body. Next, we need to think about where people commonly remove hair on the upper body. Option A, arm, is a common area for hair removal, so it could be a possible answer. Option B, mammals, is not a body part and does not make sense in the context of the question. Therefore, the answer is A. arm.	0.009009009009009009	0.0	0.02702702702702703	0.04504504504504504	0.07207207207207207	0.02702702702702703	0.036036036036036036	0.26126126126126126	0.08108108108108109	0.0	0.08108108108108109	0.04504504504504504	0.15315315315315314	0.0	0.009009009009009009	111
1100	The children were going to play. This means they were going to engage in some physical activity. The parents encouraged it. This means they wanted the children to play. Now, why would they want the children to play? The answer is likely to be related to some benefit that the children would get from playing. Option A: Being entertained. This is a possible answer, but it doesn't seem like the most likely one. If the parents just wanted the children to be entertained, they could have put on a movie or given them some toys to play with. Option B: Spending money. This doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence. There's no indication that the parents wanted the children to spend money. Option C: Intermission. This doesn't make sense either. Intermission usually refers to a break in a performance or event, and there's no indication that there was a performance or event happening. Option D: Weight loss. This is unlikely to be the answer. While playing can certainly help with weight loss, it's not usually the primary reason parents encourage their children to play. Option E: Sleepiness. This is also unlikely to be the answer. While physical activity can make children tired, it's not usually the goal of parents to make their children sleepy. Therefore, the most likely answer is A. The parents encouraged the children to play because they wanted them to be entertained.	0.0539568345323741	0.0	0.0	0.05755395683453238	0.09712230215827339	0.02877697841726619	0.039568345323741004	0.20863309352517986	0.04316546762589928	0.0035971223021582736	0.1366906474820144	0.039568345323741004	0.1223021582733813	0.0	0.0	278

1102	First, we need to understand why bees might be attracted to someone who has been drinking cider. Cider is made from fermented apples, which can produce a sweet smell that bees are attracted to. Therefore, it is important to be careful around bees in areas where there are apple orchards or fields of flowers, as these are places where bees are likely to be present. Additionally, beehives should always be approached with caution, as disturbing the bees can lead to stings. Therefore, the correct answer is C. beehive.	0.05	0.0	0.01	0.05	0.17	0.04	0.05	0.2	0.1	0.0	0.1	0.07	0.12	0.0	0.02	100

1105	The sentence mentions that the person lived on the tenth storey of a walk-up. This means that the building does not have an elevator and the person has to walk up the stairs to reach their apartment. Option A, skyscraper, is unlikely because skyscrapers usually have elevators and are not referred to as walk-ups. Option B, book of stories, is a metaphorical answer and does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Option C, tall building, is a vague answer and could refer to any building that is tall. Option D, apartment building, is the most likely answer because it specifies that the person lives in an apartment and the building does not have an elevator. Option E, mall, is unlikely because malls are not typically residential buildings and do not have storeys.

Option C, hard, is the opposite of what the person wants in a mattress. A hard mattress would not be soft, so it can be eliminated. Option D, harsh, is similar to hard and also does not fit with the desired softness of the mattress, so it can be eliminated. This leaves us with option E, firm.

This refers to a location where multiple businesses have their own individual storefronts within a larger building or complex. A. A supermarket typically only has one business operating within it, so this is not the correct answer. B. ""Store"" is a very general term and could refer to any type of business, but it does not necessarily imply that multiple businesses are located in the same building. C. A mall is a large shopping complex that typically has many stores and businesses located within it, making it a good candidate for the correct answer. D. A market could refer to a specific type of business (such as a farmer's market or fish market), but it does not necessarily imply that multiple businesses are located in the same building. E. A shopping center is similar to a mall in that it typically has multiple businesses located within it, making it another good candidate for the correct answer. Therefore, the correct answer is either C. mall or E. shopping center, depending on the specific context of the question."	0.023148148148148147	0.0	0.004629629629629629	0.06018518518518518	0.07407407407407407	0.018518518518518517	0.041666666666666664	0.20833333333333334	0.09259259259259259	0.009259259259259259	0.0787037037037037	0.10648148148148148	0.10185185185185185	0.0	0.013888888888888888	216

1120	If you get warm too much, your body will start to sweat in order to cool down. This is the body's natural way of regulating its temperature. If you continue to get too warm, you may start to feel uncomfortable and restless. You may also experience fatigue and drowsiness, which could lead to sleeping. However, if you take steps to cool down, such as drinking water, moving to a cooler environment, or taking a cool shower, you may start to feel more comfortable and less warm. Cuddling may also provide some comfort, but it may not necessarily help with cooling down. Feeling guilty is not a direct result of getting warm too much. Therefore, the correct answer is C. sweating.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.06474820143884892	0.07194244604316546	0.02158273381294964	0.08633093525179857	0.1223021582733813	0.07194244604316546	0.0	0.16546762589928057	0.10071942446043165	0.12949640287769784	0.0	0.007194244604316547	139

1125	First, we know that the crab was feeling cold in the water. This means that the water was likely colder than the crab's preferred temperature range. Next, we can eliminate options B, C, and D because they are not bodies of water. Option A, the Gulf of Mexico, is a warm body of water, so it is unlikely that the crab would be feeling cold there. This leaves us with option E, the North Sea, which is a cold body of water. Therefore, the crab was likely stuck in the North Sea and feeling cold due to the water temperature.

1127	First, we need to understand the question properly. It seems like there might be a mistake in the wording. Assuming the question is asking about the goal of having long sex, the answer would be:B. A wonderful thing.Long sex can be a pleasurable and intimate experience for both partners, and can help strengthen the emotional bond between them. It can also lead to increased physical satisfaction and a sense of closeness. However, it's important to note that the length of sex is not the only factor that determines its quality, and that communication and mutual respect are key to a fulfilling sexual experience.	0.00847457627118644	0.0	0.00847457627118644	0.06779661016949153	0.1016949152542373	0.01694915254237288	0.03389830508474576	0.1864406779661017	0.0847457627118644	0.0	0.11016949152542373	0.1016949152542373	0.1016949152542373	0.0	0.00847457627118644	118

1139	Janet likes dancing, which means she enjoys the activity. The swaying and the music are part of the dancing experience. Therefore, we can assume that the swaying and the music contribute positively to her enjoyment of dancing. Now, the question asks for the feeling that the swaying and the music give her. We can eliminate options D and E, as sore feet and fatigue are not positive feelings. Option A, rhythmic movement, could be a possibility, as dancing involves moving to a rhythm. However, it doesn't fully capture the emotional aspect of the question. Option C, euphoria, seems like the best answer. Euphoria is a feeling of intense happiness and excitement, which could be the result of the combination of swaying and music that Janet experiences while dancing. Therefore, the answer is C. Euphoria.	0.0	0.0	0.012738853503184714	0.044585987261146494	0.07006369426751592	0.01910828025477707	0.03821656050955414	0.2484076433121019	0.07643312101910828	0.0	0.08280254777070063	0.03821656050955414	0.14012738853503184	0.0	0.01910828025477707	157

1142	James wanted a hot tub just like the one at the spa he visited, but he didn't want anyone to know about it. This means he wanted to keep it a secret. Why? Because he was afraid that if the neighbors knew, they'd all want to use it. So, what would happen if the neighbors started using his hot tub? It would turn his house into what? The answer is A. country club. If James' neighbors started using his hot tub, it would be like they were all members of a country club, where they could all use the facilities.

1146	First, we know that James needed a blanket to cover the burn marks on the floor. Option A, synagogue, is unlikely to be the source of the blanket as it is a place of worship and not typically a location where blankets are stored or available for use. Option B, table, is also unlikely as tables are not typically used to store blankets. Option C, carpet, is also unlikely as a carpet would not be used to cover burn marks as it would likely be damaged further. Option D, general store, is a possibility as blankets are commonly sold in stores. However, we do not know if James had time to go to a store to purchase a blanket. Option E, bed, is a likely source of the blanket as many people keep extra blankets on their beds for warmth or comfort.

Next, the question states that Sarah just wanted to enjoy herself. This suggests that she was not trying to spend money unnecessarily, so option B, spend money, is unlikely. The question also states that it turned out to be anything but a good idea. This eliminates option E, have fun. Finally, buying alcohol with a fake ID is illegal, so option C, get arrested, is a possibility.

1151	First, a meteor is a small piece of rock or debris that travels through space. It does not have its own propulsion system, so it cannot travel on its own. Second, when a meteor enters a planet's atmosphere, it is called a meteoroid. The friction with the atmosphere causes it to heat up and create a streak of light in the sky, which is called a meteor or shooting star. Third, if a meteoroid survives the entry into the atmosphere and lands on the planet's surface, it is called a meteorite. Therefore, a meteor does not travel around galactic objects. It may pass by them or be influenced by their gravitational pull, but it does not have a specific orbit like a planet or moon. The correct answer is D. in a vacuum.	0.026143790849673203	0.0	0.0	0.0784313725490196	0.08496732026143791	0.0196078431372549	0.026143790849673203	0.2222222222222222	0.0915032679738562	0.0	0.08496732026143791	0.0457516339869281	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.058823529411764705	153

1166	First, we need to consider the habitat of monkeys. Monkeys are primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, such as rainforests, savannas, and mangrove forests. Option A, a friend's house, is unlikely as monkeys are not typically kept as pets and it is illegal in many places. Option B, a research laboratory, may have monkeys, but they would not be in the wild. Option C, the French government, is not relevant to the question. Option D, a beach, is also unlikely as monkeys do not typically live in coastal areas. Option E, Madagascar, is a possible location as it is home to several species of lemurs, which are a type of primate. However, lemurs are not technically monkeys, so this answer is not completely accurate. Therefore, the best answer is E, Madagascar, but it is important to note that not all primates found in the wild are monkeys.	0.01675977653631285	0.0	0.00558659217877095	0.027932960893854747	0.10614525139664804	0.00558659217877095	0.055865921787709494	0.21787709497206703	0.08379888268156424	0.0	0.0446927374301676	0.08379888268156424	0.16759776536312848	0.0	0.0223463687150838	179
1167	First, we need to identify which state(s) have a Great Lake. The Great Lakes are a group of five large freshwater lakes located in the northeastern part of North America, primarily on the border between the United States and Canada. The five lakes are Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario.Next, we need to identify which of these states have a steakhouse that could potentially offer a view of a Great Lake.A. Michigan - Michigan is a state that borders four of the five Great Lakes, including Lake Michigan. It is highly likely that a steakhouse in Michigan could offer a view of Lake Michigan.B. Florida - Florida does not border any of the Great Lakes, so it is unlikely that a steakhouse in Florida would offer a view of a Great Lake.C. Kansas City - Kansas City is located in Missouri, which does not border any of the Great Lakes. It is unlikely that a steakhouse in Kansas City would offer a view of a Great Lake.D. Maine - Maine is located on the northeastern coast of the United States and does not border any of the Great Lakes. It is unlikely that a steakhouse in Maine would offer a view of a Great Lake.E. Georgia - Georgia is located in the southeastern part of the United States and does not border any of the Great Lakes. It is unlikely that a steakhouse in Georgia would offer a view of a Great Lake.Therefore, the answer is A.

1168	John bought a small butane stove. He knew that he couldn't use it inside because of the fumes, but he could use it outside. This means that John needs to use the stove in an open area where there is proper ventilation. A. Community kitchen: This is an indoor space, so John cannot use the stove here. B. The post office: This is also an indoor space, so John cannot use the stove here. C. Apartment: This is an indoor space, so John cannot use the stove here. D. Friend's house: This could be an option, but it depends on whether the friend has an outdoor space where John can use the stove safely. E. Tent: This is a likely option as it is an outdoor space where John can use the stove safely. However, John needs to be careful not to use the stove too close to the tent or any flammable materials. Therefore, the most likely structure that John would use the stove outside of is E. tent.	0.01015228426395939	0.0	0.0	0.04568527918781726	0.09644670050761421	0.03553299492385787	0.08629441624365482	0.14720812182741116	0.030456852791878174	0.0	0.08121827411167512	0.06091370558375635	0.1116751269035533	0.0	0.050761421319796954	197

1171	First, we need to understand the context of the situation. Who is listening and to whom or what are they listening? Assuming that the question is referring to a person actively listening to someone else speaking, the reasons why someone would be listening could include:A. Empathy - the listener is trying to understand and connect with the speaker's emotions and experiences. B. Thirsty - this seems like an unlikely reason for someone to be listening, as thirst is a physical sensation and not related to listening. C. Hear things - the listener may be trying to gather information or details about a situation or topic. D. Knowledge - the listener may be seeking to learn new information or gain a deeper understanding of a subject. E. Learning - similar to the previous option, the listener may be actively trying to learn and absorb new information. Overall, the most likely reasons why someone would be listening are empathy, gathering information, or seeking knowledge/learning.	0.005494505494505495	0.0	0.005494505494505495	0.04945054945054945	0.0989010989010989	0.016483516483516484	0.03296703296703297	0.15934065934065933	0.06593406593406594	0.0	0.15384615384615385	0.04945054945054945	0.11538461538461539	0.0	0.02197802197802198	182
1172	The question states that the dental office handled a lot of patients who experienced traumatic mouth injury. This means that the patients were seeking treatment for their injuries at the dental office. Option A, town, is too broad and doesn't provide any specific information about where the patients were coming from. Option B, Michigan, is also too broad and doesn't provide any specific information about where the patients were coming from. Option C, office building, doesn't make sense as it's unlikely that a lot of people would experience traumatic mouth injuries in an office building. Option D, schools, is a possibility as children are more prone to accidents and injuries, and schools have a high concentration of children. However, the question doesn't specify that the patients were children, so we can't assume that they were coming from schools. Option E, hospital, is a strong possibility as hospitals are often the first point of contact for people who have experienced traumatic injuries. The hospital may have referred these patients to the dental office for specialized treatment. Therefore, the most likely answer is E, hospital.	0.04205607476635514	0.0	0.004672897196261682	0.028037383177570093	0.10747663551401869	0.037383177570093455	0.037383177570093455	0.2570093457943925	0.08878504672897196	0.0	0.07476635514018691	0.0794392523364486	0.11682242990654206	0.0	0.009345794392523364	214
1173	The upright piano is a musical instrument that produces sound. It is commonly used in music rooms, houses, bands, and colleges. Therefore, options B, C, D, and E could all be possible answers. However, without any additional context, it is impossible to determine which of these options is the correct answer. Option A, music show, is not necessarily a better answer than the others, as the upright piano could also help improve the sound quality of a music show.

1176	First, we need to identify what type of outdoor collection of merchants typically has clothing stores. Option A, Ohio, is a state and not an outdoor collection of merchants, so we can eliminate that option. Option B, buying clothing, is not an outdoor collection of merchants either, so we can eliminate that option as well. Option C, park, is an outdoor location but it is not typically a place where you would find a collection of merchants. Option E, city or town, is too broad and could include indoor shopping malls as well as outdoor collections of merchants. That leaves us with option D, strip mall, which is a type of outdoor collection of merchants that typically has clothing stores along with other retail shops. Therefore, the correct answer is D, strip mall.	0.0	0.0	0.025806451612903226	0.04516129032258064	0.08387096774193549	0.01935483870967742	0.07096774193548387	0.2645161290322581	0.07741935483870968	0.0	0.05161290322580645	0.07096774193548387	0.14193548387096774	0.0	0.01935483870967742	155
1177	First, we need to understand what a cubicle is. A cubicle is a small partitioned workspace typically found in offices. Next, we need to consider where corporations typically operate. Corporations are large companies that often have multiple employees and departments, so they require office spaces to accommodate their operations. Putting these two pieces of information together, we can conclude that the most likely place to find a cubicle for many corporations is in an office building.

Option A, many different colors, could be possible if the church has stained glass windows. However, this does not necessarily have any connection to Communion. Option B, hold water, is also not directly related to Communion. Therefore, the answer is none of the above. The glass on the walls is not necessarily relevant to taking Communion on a Sunday morning.	0.031446540880503145	0.0	0.018867924528301886	0.050314465408805034	0.1069182389937107	0.006289308176100629	0.050314465408805034	0.18867924528301888	0.09433962264150944	0.0	0.0880503144654088	0.0440251572327044	0.1320754716981132	0.0	0.05660377358490566	159
1205	First, we know that Sally's office is on the 8th and top floor. This means that the building she works in must have at least 8 floors. Option A, skyscraper, is a good possibility because skyscrapers are typically very tall buildings with many floors. Option B, tall building, is also a possibility, but it doesn't give us as much information as option A. Option C, public building, is too broad and could include many different types of buildings. Option D, school building, is unlikely because schools typically don't have 8 floors. Option E, swimming pool, is completely unrelated and can be eliminated. Therefore, the most likely answer is A. skyscraper.	0.007518796992481203	0.0	0.015037593984962405	0.03007518796992481	0.12030075187969924	0.03007518796992481	0.09022556390977443	0.23308270676691728	0.03759398496240601	0.015037593984962405	0.045112781954887216	0.10526315789473684	0.15037593984962405	0.0	0.03759398496240601	133
1206	At the end of a sleighing ride, the couple would typically stop the sleigh and get out. They may thank the driver or guide, and possibly tip them. Then, they would likely spend some time enjoying the scenery or taking photos. Depending on the situation, they may also have a warm drink or snack. As for the specific answer to the question, it would be option E, kissing, as this is a common romantic activity for couples at the end of a sleigh ride.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.052083333333333336	0.08333333333333333	0.0	0.052083333333333336	0.22916666666666666	0.11458333333333333	0.0	0.09375	0.041666666666666664	0.125	0.0	0.0	96
1207	Breathing is the process of inhaling oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide. Oxygen is necessary for the body to produce energy through cellular respiration. Without oxygen, the body's cells would not be able to function properly and would eventually die. Carbon dioxide is a waste product of cellular respiration and needs to be removed from the body. Breathing also helps regulate the pH balance of the blood by removing excess carbon dioxide. Therefore, the correct answer is C. sustaining life.	0.011363636363636364	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.045454545454545456	0.2840909090909091	0.09090909090909091	0.011363636363636364	0.125	0.06818181818181818	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.011363636363636364	88

1210	"The question is asking about a person who is supported by those closest to them. This means that the person has people in their life who are providing them with help, encouragement, and possibly even financial or emotional support. Option A, ""support group,"" seems like a good fit for this description. A support group is a group of people who come together to provide each other with emotional or practical support. If a person has a support group, it means they have a network of people who are there for them when they need it. Option B, ""get enough sleep,"" doesn't really fit with the question. While getting enough sleep is important for overall health and well-being, it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with being supported by others. Option C, ""nice family,"" is a possibility. If a person has a supportive family, it means that their family members are there for them and care about their well-being. However, the question doesn't specify that the support is coming from family members specifically. Option D, ""strong bones,"" is completely unrelated to the question. Option E, ""compliments,"" doesn't really fit either. While compliments can be a form of support, they are not the same as the kind of support that the question is asking about.

1211	First, we need to identify where the pantry is located. The pantry is usually a small room or cupboard used for storing food and dishes. It is typically located in or near the kitchen. Next, we need to consider how food is stored in the pantry. Food is typically stored on shelves in the pantry. These shelves can be made of wood, metal, or plastic and are designed to hold food items of various sizes and shapes. Therefore, the answer is D. shelf.	0.07368421052631578	0.0	0.021052631578947368	0.031578947368421054	0.09473684210526316	0.021052631578947368	0.06315789473684211	0.23157894736842105	0.08421052631578947	0.0	0.1368421052631579	0.021052631578947368	0.12631578947368421	0.0	0.021052631578947368	95

Burial: Burial is a method of disposing of a deceased person's body, so it cannot be the answer.D. Suicide: Suicide is a deliberate act of taking one's own life, so it can be assumed that the person wanted to die.E. Murder: Murder is the intentional killing of another person without their consent, so the person's death is not wanted by them.Therefore, the answer is E. murder.	0.03875968992248062	0.0	0.0	0.06976744186046512	0.11627906976744186	0.046511627906976744	0.023255813953488372	0.1937984496124031	0.05426356589147287	0.0	0.08527131782945736	0.03875968992248062	0.13953488372093023	0.0	0.031007751937984496	129
1213	The child wants his cereal bowl, so we know it's a type of dish. Option A mentions breakfast food, which could include cereal, but it doesn't specify where the bowl is. Option B mentions a china shop, which is unlikely to have the bowl the child wants. Option D mentions a refrigerator, which is also unlikely to have the bowl. That leaves us with options C and E, both of which mention a type of storage space in a kitchen. However, a refrigerator is not typically used to store bowls, so we can eliminate option D. Therefore, the most likely answer is C, kitchen cabinet, or E, cupboard, as these are both common places to store dishes in a kitchen.	0.0070921985815602835	0.0	0.02127659574468085	0.0425531914893617	0.0851063829787234	0.014184397163120567	0.03546099290780142	0.24822695035460993	0.04964539007092199	0.0	0.09219858156028368	0.028368794326241134	0.1347517730496454	0.0	0.0070921985815602835	141
1214	James used an axe and a saw to chop wood, shape it, and make a shelter. This means he was building something that could protect him from the elements. He kept adding wood to it, building it bigger and bigger. This suggests that he was building something more substantial than just a simple shelter. Option A, shelterbelt, refers to a row of trees or shrubs planted to provide shelter from wind or to protect soil from erosion. This doesn't fit the description of what James was building. Option B, tree, doesn't make sense either. James was using wood from trees to build his shelter, so he couldn't have been building a tree. Option C, house, is a possibility. A house is a more permanent structure than a shelter, and it can be built using wood. However, we don't have enough information to say for sure that James was building a house. Option D, home, is similar to option C. A home is a place where someone lives, and it can be built using wood. However, we still don't have enough information to say for sure that James was building a home. Option E, bus stop, doesn't fit the description at all. James was building something to protect himself, not to provide shelter for people waiting for a bus. Based on the information given, the best answer is C. house. However, it's important to note that we don't have enough information to say for sure what James was building.	0.05442176870748299	0.0	0.01020408163265306	0.0782312925170068	0.1054421768707483	0.02040816326530612	0.034013605442176874	0.17346938775510204	0.05442176870748299	0.0	0.14285714285714285	0.047619047619047616	0.1292517006802721	0.0	0.030612244897959183	294

1223	The question is asking where kids gather in the entrance hall at the request of teachers. This implies that it is a place where teachers and kids interact, and it is a place where kids go to learn. Option A, house, is unlikely to be the correct answer because it is not a place where teachers would request kids to gather in the entrance hall. Option B, person, is not a place but a noun that refers to an individual. Option C, palace, is also unlikely to be the correct answer because it is not a common place for kids to gather in the entrance hall at the request of teachers. Option D, school, is the most likely answer because it is a place where teachers request kids to gather in the entrance hall for various reasons such as announcements, assemblies, or to line up for class. Option E, hospital, is unlikely to be the correct answer because it is not a place where teachers would request kids to gather in the entrance hall. Therefore, the correct answer is D, school.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.03431372549019608	0.08823529411764706	0.05392156862745098	0.014705882352941176	0.27450980392156865	0.07352941176470588	0.0	0.07352941176470588	0.05392156862745098	0.11274509803921569	0.0	0.0	204
1224	First, we need to understand what perjury is. Perjury is the act of lying or giving false information under oath in a court of law. If someone is committing perjury and it leads to convictions, it means that the false information they provided was used as evidence to convict someone. This is a serious offense as it undermines the integrity of the justice system and can lead to innocent people being punished. Therefore, the correct answer is E. criminal prosecution. The person who committed perjury can be charged with a crime and face legal consequences, including fines and imprisonment.	0.05504587155963303	0.0	0.009174311926605505	0.08256880733944955	0.09174311926605505	0.01834862385321101	0.01834862385321101	0.22018348623853212	0.09174311926605505	0.0	0.1559633027522936	0.06422018348623854	0.09174311926605505	0.0	0.01834862385321101	109
1225	When you cash in, it means you are converting an asset into cash. This could be selling stocks, redeeming a bond, or withdrawing money from a bank account. So, the answer is D. withdraw or E. get money. Celebrating or feeling happy may be a personal reaction to the financial gain, but it is not a direct result of cashing in.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.05714285714285714	0.1	0.014285714285714285	0.014285714285714285	0.17142857142857143	0.08571428571428572	0.0	0.15714285714285714	0.05714285714285714	0.12857142857142856	0.0	0.014285714285714285	70
1226	First, we need to understand what poker is. Poker is a card game that involves betting and individual play, where the objective is to have the best hand or to convince other players to fold their hands. So, if you are playing poker, you are engaging in game playing. You may also be betting money, but that is not necessarily a given. Some people play poker purely for recreation or fun, without any money involved. Therefore, the correct answer is C. game playing.	0.020833333333333332	0.0	0.010416666666666666	0.07291666666666667	0.10416666666666667	0.020833333333333332	0.0625	0.21875	0.03125	0.0	0.11458333333333333	0.041666666666666664	0.13541666666666666	0.0	0.020833333333333332	96

1228	The poet wanted to promote his new literature to literary majors. This means that he wanted to reach out to students who are studying literature. Therefore, the most likely place for him to go would be a university, where he could speak to students in literature classes or hold a reading or book signing event.

1230	Refuse is typically stored in a temporary container such as a wastebasket, garbage can, or waste basket before it is disposed of. However, if the refuse is not immediately disposed of, it may be taken to a dump or landfill where it can be stored for a long time. Alternatively, some refuse may be sent to an incinerator where it is burned and turned into ash, which can also be stored for a long time. Therefore, the correct answer is either D. dump or A. incinerator, depending on the specific situation.	0.08737864077669903	0.0	0.0	0.038834951456310676	0.13592233009708737	0.02912621359223301	0.05825242718446602	0.1553398058252427	0.10679611650485436	0.0	0.1262135922330097	0.05825242718446602	0.11650485436893204	0.0	0.009708737864077669	103
1231	The woman spent her evenings working hard for herself. This means that she was focused on completing tasks or achieving something.

1232	First, we need to identify what a passage is. A passage is a piece of writing, usually longer than a sentence, that conveys a message or idea. Next, we need to consider where we would typically write down longer pieces of writing. A labyrinth is a complex maze-like structure, so it is unlikely that we would write down a passage there. The Bible is a religious text, so while it contains many passages, we would not typically write down our own passages in it. A hotel is a place where we might stay overnight, but it is not a location where we would typically write down a passage. That leaves us with two options: a diary or a journal. Both of these are personal writing spaces where we can record our thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Therefore, the answer is D. diary or E. journal.	0.0	0.0	0.0658682634730539	0.10179640718562874	0.08982035928143713	0.041916167664670656	0.05389221556886228	0.18562874251497005	0.059880239520958084	0.005988023952095809	0.07784431137724551	0.05389221556886228	0.1317365269461078	0.0	0.029940119760479042	167

1234	First, we know that Billy and Dan have known each other since childhood, which implies that they have a pre-existing relationship. This eliminates options A and D, as a contract and compliance typically involve formal agreements between parties who may not have a prior relationship.Next, we see that Billy agrees with Dan, which suggests that they are in alignment or have similar opinions. This eliminates option C, as harmony implies a state of agreement or cooperation.Finally, we can eliminate option E, as death threats are not a necessary or appropriate means of reaching an agreement.Therefore, the correct answer is B. Friendship. Billy and Dan's longstanding friendship likely provided a foundation of trust and understanding that allowed them to come to an agreement without the need for formalities or coercion.	0.019867549668874173	0.0	0.019867549668874173	0.052980132450331126	0.059602649006622516	0.033112582781456956	0.039735099337748346	0.2052980132450331	0.07947019867549669	0.0	0.09933774834437085	0.0728476821192053	0.10596026490066225	0.0	0.046357615894039736	151
1235	First, Danny needed to catch a flight. This means he was likely in a place where flights depart from, such as an airport. However, the question states that he stayed too long in an object made for humans to relax in. This rules out the airport itself, as there are no objects specifically made for relaxation in an airport (unless you count chairs, but those are not exclusive to relaxation). This leaves us with options A, B, D, and E. Option A, the bathroom, is unlikely as there are no objects specifically made for relaxation in a bathroom. Option B, the couch, is a possibility as couches are often used for relaxation. However, it is not exclusive to humans and there are couches in many places, so it is not a definitive answer. Option D, homes, is also a possibility as there are many objects made for relaxation in homes, such as sofas, recliners, and beds. Option E, the bed, is also a possibility as beds are specifically made for relaxation and are often found in homes. Therefore, the most likely answer is either option D or E, homes or a bed.	0.04405286343612335	0.0	0.004405286343612335	0.048458149779735685	0.07048458149779736	0.013215859030837005	0.06167400881057269	0.21145374449339208	0.11013215859030837	0.0	0.07048458149779736	0.04405286343612335	0.15418502202643172	0.0	0.013215859030837005	227

1237	The person in question made a choice to fight an enemy. This choice led to a grave injury. Therefore, the person is now in a critical condition. Option A, dying, is the most likely answer. Option E, death, is also a possibility if the injury is severe enough. Option B, victory, and option D, protect yourself, are not relevant to the situation described. Option C, casualties, refers to a group of people who are injured or killed in a conflict, so it is not the best answer for an individual's situation.	0.04504504504504504	0.0	0.0	0.02702702702702703	0.06306306306306306	0.009009009009009009	0.04504504504504504	0.26126126126126126	0.07207207207207207	0.0	0.07207207207207207	0.05405405405405406	0.17117117117117117	0.0	0.0	111

Therefore, we can eliminate options A, B, and E as they all have negative connotations. Now, we are left with options C and D. Each correct answer brought her more what than the last? The word ""more"" suggests that the answer should be something that increases or accumulates over time. Option C, satisfaction, fits this description perfectly. With each correct answer, the teacher's pet would feel more satisfied with herself and her abilities. Option D, teaching, doesn't quite fit as it implies that the teacher's pet was teaching others, rather than just answering questions herself.

Option A, ""remain stable,"" implies that there may be some fluctuations or changes, but the overall trend is stability. Option C, ""constant,"" implies that there is no change at all.

1243	James bought a new monitor and unpacked it. He discarded the packaging materials, which means he no longer needs them. Then, he connected it to something. The question asks what he connected it to. Option A, internet cafe, doesn't make sense because an internet cafe is a place where people go to use computers and access the internet. James wouldn't connect his monitor to an internet cafe. Option B, display images, is a possibility. James could have connected his monitor to a device that displays images, such as a computer or a gaming console. Option C, box, doesn't make sense because James discarded the packaging materials, which means he no longer needs the box. Option D, view bluescreen, doesn't make sense because a bluescreen is an error message that appears on a computer screen when there is a system error. James wouldn't connect his monitor to view a bluescreen. Option E, desktop, is the most likely answer. James probably connected his new monitor to his desktop computer.

1244	First, we need to identify the activity being described - cleaning a catch. This suggests that the vessel in question is likely to be a fishing boat, as this is where people typically catch fish. Next, we need to consider the tool being used - a knife. This suggests that the vessel needs to have a flat surface where the fish can be laid out and cut. Based on these clues, the most likely answer is A. table or E. board, as these provide a flat surface for cleaning the catch. B. kitchen drawer and D. pocket are unlikely options as they are not typically used for cleaning fish, and C. fishing boat is too broad a category to be a definitive answer.

Option C, pepper, is a spice used in cooking, but not typically in baking, so it is also unlikely. Option D, salt, is a common ingredient in baking, so it could be a possibility. Option E, small town, is not an item related to baking, so it is not a possibility. Therefore, the most likely answer is either A, baking soda, or D, salt.

If he is trying to understand the meaning of words, he would need to use a dictionary frequently. Option B, ""thesaurus,"" is also a possibility. A thesaurus is a reference book that provides synonyms and antonyms for words. If he is trying to find the right words to use in his writing, he would need to use a thesaurus frequently. Option C, ""eat cake,"" is clearly not the answer. Option D, ""novel,"" is a possibility. If he is writing a novel, he would need to use a dictionary frequently to ensure that he is using words correctly and effectively. Option E, ""encyclopedia,"" is less likely. An encyclopedia is a reference book that provides information on a wide range of topics. While he may need to use an encyclopedia for research purposes, it is less likely that he would wear out his dictionary while working on an encyclopedia.

This implies that the person values their freedom and recognizes that it is not something to be taken lightly. The sentence also states that the person ""was once a what abroad?"" This suggests that the person did not always have the same level of freedom they have now.Looking at the answer choices, we can eliminate options B, C, and D as they do not fit the context of the sentence. Option A, ""caged in,"" could be a possibility, but it is not a commonly used phrase to describe someone's lack of freedom.

The options given are: body, knee, motion, faces, and human face. Option A, body, is too broad and could refer to any part of the body. Option B, knee, is incorrect as lips are not found on the knee. Option C, motion, is not a body part and is therefore incorrect. Option D, faces, is a possibility as lips are indeed found on the face. However, option E, human face, is a more specific and accurate answer as it specifies that the lips are found on the face of a human.

Shop - This is a very broad term and could refer to any type of store. We need more information to determine if a shop sells only suntan lotion and not food or medicine. C. Grocery store - This is unlikely as grocery stores typically sell food and sometimes medicine, but not necessarily suntan lotion. D. Pharmacy - This is unlikely as pharmacies typically sell medicine and sometimes sunscreen, but not necessarily suntan lotion. E. Drugstore - This is a possibility as drugstores often sell a variety of health and beauty products, including sunscreen.

1275	Firstly, if you had a heart attack while driving at 80 mph, it is highly likely that you lost control of the car. This means that you could have crashed into something, resulting in a wrecked car (option B). Secondly, if you were lucky enough to avoid a crash, you may have been able to pull over to the side of the road or come to a stop. In this case, you may have been able to get somewhere (option C) for medical attention. However, if the heart attack was severe and you were unable to control the car or pull over, the outcome could be much worse. Unfortunately, death (option D) is a possibility in this scenario. Getting tired (option E) is not a likely outcome in this situation, as a heart attack is a serious medical emergency that requires immediate attention. Overall, the answer to this question depends on the specific circumstances of the heart attack and the actions taken by the driver and others involved. It is important to prioritize safety and seek medical attention as soon as possible in the event of a medical emergency while driving.	0.045662100456621	0.0	0.0	0.0502283105022831	0.0867579908675799	0.0319634703196347	0.0502283105022831	0.2009132420091324	0.0958904109589041	0.0045662100456621	0.0867579908675799	0.0867579908675799	0.1278538812785388	0.0	0.0136986301369863	219

1277	First, we need to consider what type of condiments we are talking about. If they are non-perishable condiments such as ketchup, mustard, or hot sauce, they can be stored in the pantry or on the table. However, if they are perishable condiments such as mayonnaise, salad dressing, or salsa, they should be stored in the refrigerator. Now, if we are planning to use the condiments soon, it would be most convenient to store them on the table or in a container that is easily accessible. However, if the condiments are perishable, we should still store them in the refrigerator until we are ready to use them. Therefore, the answer is either C (table) or D (refrigerator), depending on the type of condiments and how soon we plan to use them.	0.019230769230769232	0.0	0.038461538461538464	0.10897435897435898	0.09615384615384616	0.03205128205128205	0.0641025641025641	0.14743589743589744	0.08333333333333333	0.0	0.08974358974358974	0.07051282051282051	0.15384615384615385	0.0	0.00641025641025641	156
1278	First, someone would commit the act of killing. Then, they would likely be investigated by law enforcement. If there is enough evidence, they would be brought to court to face trial. If found guilty, they would be sentenced to jail or prison. In some cases, the punishment may include the death penalty, which would result in the person's death.

1279	First, we know that Sally bought bubblegum, which means she acquired it from somewhere. Option D, pocket, can be eliminated because it suggests that Sally already had the bubblegum in her possession, rather than purchasing it. Option E, church, is unlikely as it is not a common place to buy bubblegum. Option C, street, is possible as there are often street vendors selling candy and gum, but it is not as common as the other options. Option B, theater, is also possible as many movie theaters sell candy and gum at the concession stand. However, the most likely option is A, supermarket, as it is a common place to buy bubblegum and other types of candy.

1281	First, we need to consider the context of the question, which is enjoying the great outdoors. This suggests that we are likely in a natural setting, such as a park or hiking trail. Option A, water cooler, is unlikely to have a trash can nearby. Option B, alley, is not a natural setting and therefore not relevant to the question. Option C, park, is a likely location for a trash can. Many parks have designated areas for trash and recycling. Option D, food place, is also not a natural setting and therefore not relevant to the question. Option E, motel, is also not a natural setting and therefore not relevant to the question.

1282	"The sentence says ""He didn't have the attention span for reading book, so he would just what and pretend he was reading?"" This means that the person cannot focus on reading a book and does something else instead while pretending to read. Option A, ""sit,"" doesn't make sense because the person is already sitting while pretending to read. Option B, ""falling asleep,"" is a possibility, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the person is pretending to read while doing so. Option C, ""eat cake,"" doesn't make sense because there is no mention of cake in the sentence. Option D, ""learning,"" is unlikely because the sentence implies that the person is not actually reading or learning anything. Therefore, the correct answer is E, ""fall asleep,"" as it is a common activity that people do when they are bored or uninterested in something, and the sentence suggests that the person is pretending to read while doing so."	0.010362694300518135	0.0	0.0	0.06217616580310881	0.10362694300518134	0.06735751295336788	0.046632124352331605	0.15025906735751296	0.031088082901554404	0.0	0.15025906735751296	0.03626943005181347	0.17098445595854922	0.0	0.0	193
1283	First, we know that James owned a historic deli. This means that the deli has been around for a long time and has some historical significance. Next, we know that it had some protections that helped him keep it open. This could mean that the deli was designated as a historic landmark or had some other legal protections that prevented it from being demolished or replaced. Finally, we are asked where this deli is located. Based on the information given, the most likely answer is A. New York City. New York is known for its historic landmarks and has many buildings and businesses that are protected by law. Additionally, delis are a popular part of New York's food culture, so it makes sense that James would own a deli in this city.	0.10884353741496598	0.0	0.02040816326530612	0.08163265306122448	0.10884353741496598	0.047619047619047616	0.04081632653061224	0.14285714285714285	0.05442176870748299	0.0	0.1360544217687075	0.07482993197278912	0.09523809523809523	0.0	0.04081632653061224	147

1286	First, we need to understand what it means to kneel. Kneeling is a physical posture of humility and respect, often associated with prayer or worship. Next, we need to consider the context of the situation. The players are about to play a game, so it's unlikely that they are kneeling out of fear or because they are being watched. Therefore, the most likely answer is C. The players are kneeling to pray because they are religious and want to communicate with their God.

1289	First, it is important to determine if there has been a violation of a law or a breach of a contract. If there has been, then the next step is to consider the potential consequences of taking legal action. This includes the cost, time, and emotional toll of pursuing a civil action.Additionally, it is important to consider the evidence and the strength of the case. Is there enough evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt? Is the case strong enough to win in court?Finally, it is important to consider the potential outcomes of the civil action. Will it result in restitution or compensation for damages? Will it provide a sense of justice for the victim? Will it deter future wrongdoing?Overall, the decision to institute a civil action should be based on a careful consideration of the facts, evidence, and potential outcomes, with a focus on fairness and justice for all parties involved.	0.022988505747126436	0.0	0.0	0.05172413793103448	0.08620689655172414	0.011494252873563218	0.028735632183908046	0.21264367816091953	0.09770114942528736	0.0	0.08620689655172414	0.09770114942528736	0.10919540229885058	0.0	0.005747126436781609	174
1290	"First, we need to identify the key phrase in the question, which is ""people who do the same kind of work."" This suggests that we are looking for a place where professionals in a particular field or industry might gather. A. Train station: While people may gather at train stations, it is unlikely that people who do the same kind of work would gather there specifically for that reason. B. Convention: This is a strong possibility, as conventions are often held for specific industries or professions, and provide an opportunity for people to network and learn from each other. C. Workplace: This is also a possibility, as people who work in the same field or industry may work in the same office or building. However, this is not always the case, and people may work remotely or in different locations. D. Wedding: While people who work in the same field or industry may attend weddings together, this is not a place where they are likely to gather specifically for work-related purposes. E. Theater: This is unlikely, as people who work in the same field or industry are not likely to gather at a theater unless it is for a specific work-related event or performance.

1291	After eating dinner, the food is broken down in the stomach and nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream. This process can cause a feeling of fullness. As digestion continues, the body may also experience a decrease in energy levels, leading to tiredness. Some people may experience heartburn or indigestion if they have eaten too much or consumed certain foods that are difficult to digest. Flatulence, or passing gas, may also occur as a result of digestion. Therefore, all of the options listed could potentially happen after eating dinner, but the specific experience may vary from person to person.	0.04504504504504504	0.0	0.0	0.018018018018018018	0.09009009009009009	0.009009009009009009	0.05405405405405406	0.23423423423423423	0.12612612612612611	0.0	0.16216216216216217	0.02702702702702703	0.11711711711711711	0.0	0.0	111

1296	Having a check-up usually involves visiting a doctor or healthcare professional to assess one's health. This can lead to different outcomes for different people. Some people may experience pain during the check-up, but this is not a common outcome. Good behavior is not a likely outcome either, as having a check-up is not related to behavior. Uncertainty may arise if the results of the check-up are inconclusive or if further testing is needed. However, the most common outcome for many people is anxiety or stress, especially if they are worried about their health or if they anticipate bad news from the check-up.

1297	The question states that the prize was prestigious, which means it was highly regarded and respected. However, it had no money, which means the prize was not a financial reward. Therefore, the person competing for the prize was not seeking money. Option A, enemies, does not make sense in this context. Competing for a prize does not typically involve seeking enemies. Option B, rivalry, is a possibility. Competing for a prestigious prize could indicate a desire to prove oneself against others and establish oneself as the best in a particular field. Option C, bad blood, does not fit the context. There is no indication of any negative feelings or animosity between the person competing and anyone else. Option D, accomplishment, is a strong possibility. Competing for a prestigious prize could indicate a desire to achieve something significant and meaningful, even if there is no financial reward. Option E, game, does not fit the context. Competing for a prize is not typically seen as a game or a trivial pursuit. Therefore, the most likely answer is D.

1298	The flour was stored away from the kids, which means it was put in a place where they couldn't reach it. The options given are pantry, grocery store, cupboard, kitchen, and table. A pantry is a storage area in a house where food and other household items are kept. This could be a possible answer as it is a common place to store flour. A grocery store is a place where food is sold, so it wouldn't make sense for the flour to be stored there. A cupboard is a cabinet or a closet used for storing things, including food items. This could also be a possible answer as flour is often stored in cupboards. A kitchen is a room where food is prepared and cooked, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the flour was stored there. A table is a flat surface used for eating, working, or playing games. It wouldn't make sense for the flour to be stored on a table as it is not a proper storage area.

1299	The teacher explained that it used a cathode ray tube, which is a type of vacuum tube. So, option A is a possible answer. However, the question asks what measured things, not what type of tube was used. A television and a computer are both types of screens, but they do not measure things. So, options B and C can be eliminated. A cathode ray is a stream of electrons emitted from the cathode of a high-vacuum tube, but it does not measure things either. So, option D can also be eliminated. Finally, an oscilloscope is a device used to measure and display waveforms of electrical signals. Therefore, option E is the correct answer.

1302	First, we need to understand what elevation sickness is. It is a condition that occurs when a person ascends to high altitudes too quickly, and their body is not able to adjust to the lower air pressure and reduced oxygen levels. This can cause symptoms such as headache, nausea, dizziness, and confusion.Now, let's look at the options. A, diminishment, and B, reduction, both mean a decrease or lessening of something, which could be applicable to the climber's condition. C, depression, refers to a state of low mood or sadness, which may not be the best fit for this situation. D, demotion, means a reduction in rank or status, which is not relevant here. E, disgust, means a feeling of revulsion or strong dislike, which is also not applicable.Therefore, the best answer is A, diminishment, as it accurately describes the climber's wits being affected by the elevation sickness.	0.010869565217391304	0.0	0.005434782608695652	0.043478260869565216	0.06521739130434782	0.005434782608695652	0.043478260869565216	0.24456521739130435	0.07065217391304347	0.0	0.08152173913043478	0.059782608695652176	0.17391304347826086	0.0	0.005434782608695652	184

1304	First, it's important to understand that printing money can actually contribute to inflation, as it increases the supply of money without a corresponding increase in goods and services. So, if the goal is to fight inflation, printing more money may not be the best solution.Instead, measures such as increasing interest rates, reducing government spending, and promoting economic growth through investment in infrastructure and education may be more effective in combating inflation.Therefore, the answer is C. Not very much, as printing more money may actually worsen the problem of inflation.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.01904761904761905	0.08571428571428572	0.01904761904761905	0.08571428571428572	0.23809523809523808	0.10476190476190476	0.0	0.11428571428571428	0.0761904761904762	0.12380952380952381	0.0	0.009523809523809525	105

1307	First, we know that there was a dog barking loudly. Next, we know that James wasn't scared of it because it was confined. This means that the dog was not able to freely move around and potentially harm James. Based on this information, we can eliminate options B, D, and E as unlikely places for the dog to be confined. Option C, the front door, is also unlikely as it would be difficult to confine a dog to a door. Therefore, the most likely answer is A, the backyard. It is common for dogs to be confined to a backyard with a fence or other barrier to prevent them from running away or causing harm to others.	0.05970149253731343	0.0	0.022388059701492536	0.06716417910447761	0.08955223880597014	0.029850746268656716	0.07462686567164178	0.15671641791044777	0.08208955223880597	0.0	0.11194029850746269	0.06716417910447761	0.11940298507462686	0.0	0.022388059701492536	134
1308	The magician guessed it was a king. This suggests that the magician is skilled at making accurate guesses or predictions. The question asks what the magician is good with. Option A, hierarchy, refers to a system of ranking or organizing people or things. While this may be useful knowledge for a magician, it does not directly relate to guessing the identity of a king. Option B, court, could refer to a royal court or a legal court. Again, while knowledge of courts may be useful for a magician, it does not directly relate to guessing the identity of a king. Option C, chess game, involves strategy and predicting an opponent's moves. While this may be a useful skill for a magician, it does not directly relate to guessing the identity of a king. Option D, deck of cards, is a more likely answer. Magicians often use decks of cards in their performances, and being skilled with a deck of cards could help a magician make accurate guesses or predictions. Option E, chess set, is similar to option C. While chess involves strategy and predicting an opponent's moves, it does not directly relate to guessing the identity of a king.

1309	First, we need to identify what the blinking light on the driver's side is. It could be a turn signal or a hazard light. If it's a turn signal, it indicates that the driver intends to turn in the direction of the blinking light. So, if the light is blinking on the left side, the driver intends to turn left. If the light is blinking on the right side, the driver intends to turn right. If it's a hazard light, it indicates that the driver is experiencing some sort of emergency or issue with their vehicle and is warning other drivers to proceed with caution. In this case, it doesn't necessarily indicate a specific action the driver will take.

The other options, such as crossing the street or bringing something home, do not make sense in this context.

1311	First, we know that the dairy cow farm is special because it provides all the milk for a big chocolate company. This means that the milk is likely being used to make chocolate products, so we can assume that the chocolate company is located somewhere that produces chocolate. Option A, ranch, is too general and doesn't give us any specific location information. Option B, Tennessee, is a specific location but doesn't have a strong association with chocolate production. Option C, barnyard, is not a location and doesn't help us identify where the chocolate company is located. Option D, Switzerland, is a well-known location for chocolate production and has a strong association with high-quality chocolate. Option E, Antarctica, is not a location where dairy cows can thrive and is not known for chocolate production. Therefore, the most likely answer is D. Switzerland.	0.029585798816568046	0.0	0.023668639053254437	0.03550295857988166	0.11242603550295859	0.04142011834319527	0.03550295857988166	0.23668639053254437	0.029585798816568046	0.0	0.08875739644970414	0.05917159763313609	0.13609467455621302	0.0	0.03550295857988166	169
1312	The question mentions that the person plays the saxophone and has to learn choreographed moves on the field. This suggests that they are part of a group that performs on a field, likely during a halftime show or parade. Option A, music store, doesn't make sense in this context as it is a place to buy instruments and not a performance group. Option B, actors, also doesn't fit as the question is specifically asking about a musical performance. Option C, store sells instruments, is similar to option A and doesn't fit the context of the question. Option E, orchestra, is a possibility as they also perform music, but the mention of choreographed moves on the field suggests a more physical performance. This leaves us with option D, marching band, which is a group that performs music while marching and often includes choreographed moves on the field. Therefore, the answer is D, marching band.	0.0	0.0	0.0056179775280898875	0.033707865168539325	0.06179775280898876	0.016853932584269662	0.03932584269662921	0.28651685393258425	0.07865168539325842	0.0	0.0898876404494382	0.033707865168539325	0.12359550561797752	0.0	0.0	178

1314	First, we need to know where the Mississippi River is located. The Mississippi River is a major river in the United States that flows from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. Next, we need to know where bald eagles can be found. Bald eagles are found throughout North America, but they are most commonly found near bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, and coastlines. Based on this information, we can eliminate options C, D, and E as they are not states in the United States. Option A, Iowa, is located near the Mississippi River, but it is not known for its bald eagle population. Option B, Wisconsin, is known for its bald eagle population and is a popular spot for eagle watching along the Mississippi River. Therefore, the answer is B.

1316	First, we need to identify which side won the U.S. Civil War. The Union (also known as the North) won the war. Next, we need to find the country that is furthest in the direction of the Union from the Carpathian Mountains. The Carpathians run through several countries in Eastern Europe, including Slovakia, Poland, Ukraine, and Romania. To determine which country is furthest in the direction of the Union, we need to look at a map. If we draw a line from the Carpathians to the North, we can see that Poland is the furthest in that direction. Therefore, the answer is C.

1318	First, we know that the horse is motionless, meaning it is not moving. Option A, Washington, does not provide any context or location where a horse might be motionless. Option B, a painting, could depict a motionless horse, but it is not a physical location where a horse might be found. Option C, a race track, is unlikely as horses are typically moving during races. Option D, a safari, is also unlikely as horses are not typically found in the wild on safaris. Option E, a farmyard, is the most likely location where a motionless horse might be found, as horses are commonly kept on farms and may be resting or sleeping.

Option B, Texas, is located in the southern part of the country and may not have the ideal climate for growing apple trees. Option D, Idaho, is located in the western part of the country and has a climate that is suitable for growing apple trees.

Option B, lewd behavior, also suggests inappropriate behavior, but it is not specific enough to determine what exactly the teenagers were doing. Option C, happiness, is not necessarily indicative of irresponsible behavior. Option D, intimacy, is a vague term that could refer to a range of activities, some of which may be considered irresponsible. Option E, enjoyment, is too broad to determine whether the teenagers were behaving irresponsibly.

Contractual obligation - There is no mention of any contracts or agreements that would require the mom to provide assistance to her children. D. Happiness - This could be another possible reason. The mom may feel happy and fulfilled when she helps her children. E. Out of pocket - This option doesn't make sense in this context.

1323	First, we know that there is a bird in a tree. The question is asking what the bird has in the tree. Option A, forest, doesn't make sense because the bird is already in a tree, which is part of a forest. Option B, hope, is an abstract concept and doesn't fit with the physical setting of the bird in a tree. Option C, sky, is also not a tangible object that the bird could have in the tree. Option D, nest, is the most likely answer. Birds often build nests in trees to lay their eggs and raise their young. Option E, roof, doesn't make sense because the bird is in a tree, not a building.

1324	The sentence mentions a dental office, a candy store, and a fast food location. These three businesses are not typically found together, as dental offices promote healthy teeth and diets, while candy stores and fast food locations promote sugary and unhealthy foods. Therefore, it is likely that these businesses are located in a place where there is a mix of different types of businesses. Option A, a medical building, is a possibility, but it is less likely because medical buildings usually house healthcare-related businesses and not retail businesses like candy stores and fast food locations. Option B, a hospital, is also unlikely because hospitals usually have strict regulations on the types of businesses that can be located nearby, and they prioritize healthcare-related businesses. Option C, a school, is also unlikely because schools usually do not allow businesses like candy stores and fast food locations to be located nearby due to concerns about student health. Option E, an urban area, is a possibility, but it is too broad to be a definitive answer. Therefore, the most likely answer is D, a strip mall. Strip malls are known for having a mix of different types of businesses, including retail and food establishments, and they often have a lot of foot traffic. It would not be unusual to find a dental office, candy store, and fast food location all located in the same strip mall.	0.029850746268656716	0.0	0.0	0.029850746268656716	0.07835820895522388	0.022388059701492536	0.055970149253731345	0.27611940298507465	0.05970149253731343	0.0037313432835820895	0.06343283582089553	0.1044776119402985	0.12686567164179105	0.0	0.007462686567164179	268

However, here are some possible reasons:A. Acknowledgment: The person may feel that being in a relationship with this man gives them a sense of validation or recognition. They may feel that they are seen as desirable or valuable because they are with this particular person.B.

This could be a significant factor in their decision to stay in the relationship.C. Mercy: The person may feel a sense of obligation or responsibility to stay with the man, perhaps because they feel sorry for him or feel that he needs their support.D. Make others happy: The person may feel pressure from family or friends to stay in the relationship, perhaps because they believe it will make others happy or avoid conflict.E. Low crime: The person may feel that the man is a safe choice, perhaps because he has a low likelihood of committing crimes or engaging in risky behavior.Again, it's important to remember that these are just a few possible reasons why a person might stay in a relationship with a man, and there are many other factors that could come into play.

1328	First, you need to find a partner with whom you want to start a family. This could involve dating, getting to know each other, and eventually deciding to commit to a long-term relationship. Once you have found the right partner, you may choose to get married or not, depending on your personal beliefs and values. If you want to have children, you will need to have sex in order to conceive. This may involve tracking ovulation and timing intercourse accordingly. Once you become pregnant, you will need to take care of your health and prepare for the arrival of your child. This may involve prenatal care, attending childbirth classes, and setting up a nursery. Starting a family is a big decision and requires a lot of planning and preparation.

1330	The question is asking for a word that describes someone who is not ridiculous. Option A, straightforward, means someone who is direct and honest. This could be a possible answer, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the person is not ridiculous. Option B, serious, means someone who is solemn or grave in manner or disposition. This could also be a possible answer, but again, it doesn't necessarily mean that the person is not ridiculous. Option C, sad, means someone who is unhappy or sorrowful. This is not a suitable answer as it doesn't relate to the question. Option D, somber, means someone who is dark or gloomy in character. This is not a suitable answer as it doesn't relate to the question. Option E, solemn, means someone who is serious or dignified in manner or behavior. This could be the best answer as it directly relates to the question and implies that the person is not ridiculous. Therefore, the answer is E. solemn.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.09326424870466321	0.11917098445595854	0.015544041450777202	0.03626943005181347	0.12953367875647667	0.05181347150259067	0.0	0.06735751295336788	0.11398963730569948	0.13471502590673576	0.0	0.0	193
1331	Bald eagles are birds of prey that are native to North America. They are often associated with the United States and are even the national bird and symbol of the country. Now, considering the options given, we can eliminate A, B, D, and E. A painting is not a real-life location where you would see a bald eagle. An aviary is a controlled environment where birds are kept in captivity, so it's not a natural setting. A zoo is also a controlled environment, and while some zoos may have bald eagles on display, it's not where you would typically see them in the wild. Colorado is a state in the western United States, and while it is home to bald eagles, it's not the only place where they can be found. That leaves us with C, rural areas. Bald eagles are often found near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and coastlines. They prefer areas with tall trees for nesting and hunting. Rural areas, especially those near bodies of water, are more likely to have the natural habitat that bald eagles need to thrive. Therefore, the correct answer is C, rural area.	0.030837004405286344	0.0	0.00881057268722467	0.06167400881057269	0.10572687224669604	0.030837004405286344	0.039647577092511016	0.19383259911894274	0.07048458149779736	0.0	0.06607929515418502	0.09691629955947137	0.13215859030837004	0.0	0.022026431718061675	227

1336	First, we can assume that people who get up early have a reason for doing so, such as work, exercise, or personal preference. Next, we can assume that in order to get up early, they likely go to bed early in order to get enough sleep. They may also fix up an alarm to ensure they wake up on time. It is possible that they ask their spouse or partner to wake them up, but this cannot be assumed for all early risers. Lastly, it is unlikely that they have a rooster to wake them up, as this is not a common practice in most urban or suburban areas. Therefore, the most accurate assumptions we can make about people who get up early are that they go to bed early and use an alarm to wake up. The answer is D. go to bed early.	0.006134969325153374	0.0	0.018404907975460124	0.09815950920245399	0.07975460122699386	0.03067484662576687	0.08588957055214724	0.1411042944785276	0.12269938650306748	0.0	0.12269938650306748	0.06748466257668712	0.10429447852760736	0.0	0.012269938650306749	163

Therefore, a lizard that needs warmth is likely to live in a place where it can find enough heat to survive. Option A: Garden - While some lizards may live in gardens, it does not necessarily mean that they can find enough warmth there. Gardens can be cool and shady, especially in certain seasons or climates. Option B: New Mexico books - This option does not make sense as it is not a place where a lizard can live. Option C: Tropics - The tropics are known for their warm and humid climate, which can provide an ideal habitat for many lizard species. Therefore, this option is a likely answer. Option D: China - China is a vast country with diverse climates and habitats, so it is possible that some lizards live there. However, without more information, we cannot assume that all lizards in China can find enough warmth. Option E: Forrest - Forests can be cool and damp, which may not be suitable for lizards that need warmth. However, some forest areas may have sunny spots or warm microclimates that can support lizard populations.

1351	When chatting with friends, the first thing most people hope to achieve is feeling close to them. This can involve sharing personal stories, discussing common interests, and expressing emotions. Exchanging information is also a common goal, as friends often share news, updates, and advice with each other. Love may be a desired outcome for some, but it is not necessarily the primary goal of chatting with friends. Social approval may be a subconscious desire for some individuals, but it is not typically the main reason for chatting with friends. Exchanging smiles can be a pleasant side effect of a positive conversation, but it is not a primary goal.

Option C, shelf, also doesn't make sense because we don't know what kind of shelf it would be. Option E, restroom, is also unlikely because it's not a place where people typically keep food.

1353	First, we know that Sally and Joe were burned by chemicals. This suggests that they were in an environment where chemicals were present. Option A, a swimming pool, is unlikely to cause chemical burns unless there was a chemical spill or accident. Option B, a beach, is also unlikely to cause chemical burns unless they came into contact with a hazardous substance. Option C, a crystal meth lab, is a possible location for chemical burns as the production of methamphetamine involves the use of dangerous chemicals. Option D, a chemistry lab, is also a possible location for chemical burns as it is a place where chemicals are used and handled. Option E, a laboratory, is similar to a chemistry lab and could also be a possible location for chemical burns. Given that Sally had chemical burns in her vagina, it is more likely that they were in a location where they were exposed to chemicals in a more intimate way. Therefore, options C, D, and E are more likely than options A and B. Overall, the most likely location for Sally and Joe to have been burned by chemicals and for Sally to have sustained chemical burns in her vagina is either a crystal meth lab or a chemistry laboratory.	0.06808510638297872	0.0	0.00425531914893617	0.0425531914893617	0.09361702127659574	0.03829787234042553	0.03829787234042553	0.225531914893617	0.08936170212765958	0.0	0.05531914893617021	0.08085106382978724	0.10638297872340426	0.0	0.03404255319148936	235

1372	When a person climbs a mountain, they are likely to experience physical exertion and fatigue. However, as they reach higher altitudes, the air becomes fresher and less polluted. This can lead to an increase in oxygen intake, which can have several positive effects on the body and mind. Therefore, the person is likely to feel:A. Exhilaration - Climbing a mountain can be a challenging and rewarding experience, and reaching the summit can give a sense of accomplishment and excitement.B. Clear head - The fresh air can help clear the mind and improve focus and concentration.C. Feeling better - The physical activity and fresh air can improve overall well-being and mood.D. Reviving - The fresh air can help rejuvenate the body and mind, providing a sense of renewal and energy.E. Happiness - The combination of physical activity, natural beauty, and fresh air can lead to a sense of joy and happiness.Therefore, the person is likely to have a combination of these feelings when climbing a mountain and breathing fresh air.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.01015228426395939	0.07106598984771574	0.01015228426395939	0.025380710659898477	0.233502538071066	0.050761421319796954	0.0	0.09644670050761421	0.1065989847715736	0.1319796954314721	0.0	0.015228426395939087	197
1373	An unsuccessful writing program may cause frustration and aggravation for the user who is trying to write. It may also lead to unexpected results, such as errors or incorrect formatting. However, it is unlikely to cause bugs in the traditional sense, as bugs are typically caused by errors in the program's code rather than its functionality. Satisfaction is also unlikely to be a result of an unsuccessful writing program.

1374	First, we need to understand what a pit is. In the context of music, a pit is typically a sunken area in front of a stage where musicians play during a theatrical or operatic performance. Next, we need to consider the instrument in question, which is a flute. Flutes are commonly used in orchestras, symphonies, and marching bands. Therefore, the most likely answer is B. orchestra, as flutes are a common instrument in orchestral music and would be played by musicians in the pit during a theatrical or operatic performance.	0.019417475728155338	0.0	0.019417475728155338	0.02912621359223301	0.07766990291262135	0.009708737864077669	0.05825242718446602	0.23300970873786409	0.11650485436893204	0.0	0.06796116504854369	0.07766990291262135	0.1262135922330097	0.0	0.019417475728155338	103

Option B, dress, is also unlikely as clothing has nothing to do with intelligence. Option C, brains, is the most likely answer as intelligence is often associated with the brain. Option D, brown hair, is irrelevant to intelligence. Option E, two eyes, is also irrelevant to intelligence.

1376	First, we need to consider why the ficus would get the carpet dirty. Ficus plants can drop leaves and sap, which can stain carpets. Next, we need to think about where the ficus could be placed to avoid this issue. A. Ground: If the ficus is already planted in the ground, there's not much you can do to prevent it from dropping leaves and sap on the surrounding area. B. Arboretum: An arboretum is a botanical garden dedicated to trees and other woody plants. While a ficus would certainly fit in an arboretum, it's not a practical solution for most people who just want to keep a houseplant. C. Apartment: This is a more practical option. You could place the ficus in a pot with a saucer underneath to catch any dropped leaves or sap. You could also place a mat or tray underneath the pot to further protect the carpet. D. Refrigerator: This is not a suitable location for a ficus plant. Ficus plants need sunlight and warmth to thrive, and a refrigerator is too cold and dark. E. California: This is not a location, but even if it were, it wouldn't solve the problem of the ficus dropping leaves and sap on the carpet. Therefore, the best answer is C. Apartment.	0.0205761316872428	0.0	0.00823045267489712	0.04526748971193416	0.08641975308641975	0.0205761316872428	0.04938271604938271	0.18930041152263374	0.053497942386831275	0.0	0.10699588477366255	0.0411522633744856	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.012345679012345678	243
1377	"The first part of the sentence states that she was distracted in thought in class. The second part of the sentence suggests that she felt alone. The next word ""even"" implies that despite something, she still felt alone. Option A suggests that she was with someone, but still felt alone. This could be a possibility, but it is not explicitly stated in the sentence. Option B suggests that there were many people around her, but she still felt alone. This could be a possibility, but it is not explicitly stated in the sentence. Option C suggests that she was with others, but still felt alone. This is similar to option A, but it is more general and could include being with a group of people in class. Option D suggests that she was surrounded by people, but still felt alone. This is a strong possibility as it directly addresses the feeling of being alone despite being in a crowded space. Option E suggests that she was in a crowd, but still felt alone. This is similar to option D, but it is more specific to being in a large group of people.

1378	First, we need to consider what materials we could make a hole in with our fist. A fist is a relatively small and blunt object, so it would likely have difficulty making a hole in harder materials like metal or concrete. Option A, Swiss cheese, is a food item and not a material that we would typically make a hole in. Option B, a football ground, is a large outdoor space and not a specific material that we could make a hole in with our fist. Option C, the ground, is a possibility. Depending on the type of soil or dirt, it may be possible to make a small hole with a fist. Option D, a golf course, is similar to option B in that it is a large outdoor space and not a specific material that we could make a hole in with our fist. Option E, a wall, is a possibility. Depending on the material of the wall (e.g. drywall, plaster, wood), it may be possible to make a small hole with a fist. Therefore, the most likely answer is either C (ground) or E (wall), depending on the specific circumstances.	0.0	0.0	0.03524229074889868	0.07048458149779736	0.07929515418502203	0.00881057268722467	0.030837004405286344	0.2422907488986784	0.07929515418502203	0.0	0.05286343612334802	0.07488986784140969	0.14977973568281938	0.0	0.00881057268722467	227
1379	If your legs are tired, it means you have been using them for a while and they need a break. Therefore, option D (run) is not the correct answer. Option A (sleep) and C (go to bed) are not necessary for just tired legs, as you may not be tired enough to sleep or go to bed. Option E (closing eyes) may help you relax, but it does not necessarily give your legs the rest they need.

However, since the question specifically mentions wet cleaning, we can eliminate option C (vacuuming) as it is not suitable for wet cleaning. Next, we need to consider what tool is best for wet cleaning a floor. Option A (fan) is not relevant to cleaning the floor, so we can eliminate it. Option B (energy) is not a tool or item needed for cleaning, so we can eliminate it as well. That leaves us with option D (mop) as the correct answer. A mop is the most appropriate tool for wet cleaning a floor as it can be used to apply cleaning solution and remove dirt and grime. Therefore, the answer is D.	0.012422360248447204	0.0	0.031055900621118012	0.06832298136645963	0.08074534161490683	0.024844720496894408	0.049689440993788817	0.20496894409937888	0.062111801242236024	0.0	0.10559006211180125	0.062111801242236024	0.15527950310559005	0.0	0.012422360248447204	161
1395	First, we need to understand what causes lightning strikes. Lightning is usually associated with thunderstorms, which are characterized by the presence of cumulonimbus clouds. These clouds are tall and dense, and they form when warm, moist air rises and cools, causing water vapor to condense into droplets. As the droplets grow larger, they fall back down to the ground, creating a downdraft. This downdraft can cause the air to become turbulent, which can lead to the formation of lightning.Based on this information, we can eliminate options A, C, D, and E, as they do not provide any information about the weather conditions that are conducive to thunderstorms. This leaves us with option B, rainy, which is the most likely answer. Rainy weather is often associated with thunderstorms, as the warm, moist air that rises to form cumulonimbus clouds is often accompanied by precipitation. Therefore, beautiful lightning strikes are most likely to happen on a rainy day.	0.02717391304347826	0.0	0.016304347826086956	0.04891304347826087	0.06521739130434782	0.005434782608695652	0.04891304347826087	0.20652173913043478	0.09239130434782608	0.0	0.13043478260869565	0.08152173913043478	0.14673913043478262	0.0	0.010869565217391304	184
1396	Drinking alcohol can affect different aspects of a person's life, but in this case, the answer is E. sleep at night. Alcohol is a depressant that can disrupt the normal sleep cycle, causing difficulty falling asleep, waking up frequently during the night, and feeling tired and groggy the next day. Therefore, drinking alcohol can make a person lose sleep at night.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.014084507042253521	0.07042253521126761	0.0	0.028169014084507043	0.2676056338028169	0.08450704225352113	0.0	0.14084507042253522	0.07042253521126761	0.1267605633802817	0.0	0.056338028169014086	71

1398	First, we need to consider where shirts are typically stored. Shirts are usually hung in a closet or folded in a drawer. A. Closet - This is a likely option as shirts are commonly hung in closets. B. Drawer - This is also a likely option as shirts can be folded and stored in drawers. C. Garderobe - This is a less common term for a closet or wardrobe, so it is possible that a shirt could be found here, but it is less likely. D. Shelf - Shirts can be stored on shelves, but this is less common in a hotel room. E. Suitcase - This is possible if a guest has left their suitcase open and a shirt is visible, but it is not a typical place for a shirt to be found in a hotel room. Therefore, the most likely options are A. closet and B. drawer.	0.06097560975609756	0.0	0.006097560975609756	0.03048780487804878	0.12804878048780488	0.024390243902439025	0.06707317073170732	0.17682926829268292	0.06707317073170732	0.0	0.07317073170731707	0.06707317073170732	0.11585365853658537	0.0	0.042682926829268296	164
1399	First, you need to pay attention to what you want to remember. This means focusing on the information and avoiding distractions. Next, you can try repeating the information to yourself or writing it down. This can help reinforce the memory. You can also try associating the information with something else that you already know well. For example, if you need to remember a phone number, you can try associating it with a familiar date or address. Finally, it's important to review the information periodically to help solidify the memory. This can be done through practice quizzes, flashcards, or simply going over the information again. So, the answer would be a combination of C, answering questions, D, stopping to think, and reviewing the information periodically.	0.00684931506849315	0.0	0.0	0.0958904109589041	0.06164383561643835	0.00684931506849315	0.0821917808219178	0.1506849315068493	0.0684931506849315	0.0	0.1917808219178082	0.0136986301369863	0.14383561643835616	0.0	0.00684931506849315	146
1400	First, we need to consider the legal drinking age in the specific location. Assuming that the person is of legal drinking age, the answer would be A. bar. A bar is a place where alcoholic beverages are served and consumed. Other options such as vending machines, bottles, and refrigerators may provide access to alcoholic beverages, but they are not typically places where people go to drink them. E. hockey game may also offer alcoholic beverages for sale, but it is not a dedicated location for drinking.	0.020618556701030927	0.0	0.010309278350515464	0.041237113402061855	0.09278350515463918	0.030927835051546393	0.030927835051546393	0.27835051546391754	0.061855670103092786	0.0	0.10309278350515463	0.09278350515463918	0.1134020618556701	0.0	0.010309278350515464	97

1402	First, we need to understand that using too much salt is a behavior, not an object. So options A, C, and E (shaker, kitchen cupboard, and table) are not likely to use too much salt. Option B, fast food restaurant, is a possibility as many fast food items are known to be high in sodium. However, it is not a specific group of people who are using too much salt in this case, but rather the food industry as a whole. Therefore, the most accurate answer is D, people. Anyone can use too much salt in their cooking or at the table, regardless of age, gender, or other demographic factors. It is important to be mindful of our salt intake and try to limit it to recommended levels for good health.	0.012903225806451613	0.0	0.012903225806451613	0.05161290322580645	0.07096774193548387	0.0064516129032258064	0.07096774193548387	0.22580645161290322	0.07096774193548387	0.0	0.06451612903225806	0.1032258064516129	0.15483870967741936	0.0	0.0064516129032258064	155

1407	A poet may need to achieve learning as an adult in order to improve their writing skills and expand their knowledge. While a classroom or English class may be helpful, they may not provide the depth of knowledge and experience a poet needs. A university may offer more advanced courses and access to resources such as libraries and writing workshops. A book store may provide inspiration and access to a wide range of literature, but may not offer the same level of instruction as a university. Ultimately, it depends on the individual poet's goals and needs. Therefore, the answer is C. university.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.035398230088495575	0.07079646017699115	0.008849557522123894	0.02654867256637168	0.2920353982300885	0.08849557522123894	0.0	0.09734513274336283	0.061946902654867256	0.08849557522123894	0.0	0.017699115044247787	113
1408	A kitchen towel is a type of towel that is used in the kitchen to dry dishes, wipe counters, and clean up spills. Therefore, it is most likely to be found in a place where kitchen items are stored. Option A: Cupboard - This is a possible location as kitchen towels are often stored in a kitchen cupboard or drawer. Option B: Hotel - While a hotel may provide towels for guests, these are typically bath towels or hand towels, not kitchen towels. Option C: Linen closet - While some households may store kitchen towels in a linen closet, this is not the most common location.

Option A, ""destroy enemy,"" is not a healthy or appropriate way to handle anger. Option B, ""punch,"" is also not a healthy or appropriate way to handle anger. Option C, ""cool off,"" is a more positive and healthy way to handle anger. This could mean taking a break, going for a walk, or doing something calming to help him calm down.

1414	First, it's important to acknowledge that witnessing bullying can be a difficult and uncomfortable situation. However, it's important to consider the impact on the person being bullied and the potential harm that could result if the behavior is not addressed.Option C, keep walking, and option D, cross the street, may seem like the easiest options, but they do not address the situation and could potentially make the person being bullied feel even more isolated and unsupported.Option E, do nothing, is also not a helpful response as it allows the bullying behavior to continue unchecked.Option A, courageous, and option B, step up, are both proactive responses that involve taking action to address the situation. This could involve speaking up to the bully, offering support to the person being bullied, or seeking help from a trusted authority figure.Ultimately, the best course of action will depend on the specific situation and the individual's comfort level. However, it's important to remember that standing up against bullying is an important step in creating a safer and more inclusive community.	0.024154589371980676	0.0	0.0	0.03864734299516908	0.09178743961352658	0.014492753623188406	0.03864734299516908	0.18840579710144928	0.06280193236714976	0.0	0.14492753623188406	0.09178743961352658	0.12077294685990338	0.0	0.004830917874396135	207
1415	The hipsters took a disingenuous kooky approach to their cafe, which means they were trying to be quirky and unconventional in a way that wasn't genuine. This approach didn't work, as they went out of business. The competitor, on the other hand, took an approach that was successful. We can infer that this approach was different from the hipsters' approach, as they were able to succeed where the hipsters failed. The answer choices are: mainstream, straight, right, conventional, and uneccentric. Out of these, the most likely answer is D. conventional, as it is the opposite of the hipsters' disingenuous kooky approach. The competitor may have taken a more traditional and straightforward approach to their cafe, which resonated with customers and allowed them to succeed.	0.08783783783783784	0.0	0.006756756756756757	0.06756756756756757	0.08783783783783784	0.013513513513513514	0.013513513513513514	0.16891891891891891	0.0945945945945946	0.0	0.08783783783783784	0.12162162162162163	0.13513513513513514	0.0	0.02027027027027027	148
1416	First, we need to consider the factors that can affect the quality and lifespan of a ballpoint pen. These factors include exposure to heat, moisture, and air. With that in mind, we can eliminate options A, B, and C as they do not provide adequate protection from these factors. A pocket can expose the pen to body heat and moisture, while a stationery store and backpack can expose the pen to air and moisture. Option E, a bank, is also not a suitable storage place for a ballpoint pen as it does not provide any protection from the elements. Therefore, the best answer is D, a desk drawer. A desk drawer can provide a cool, dry, and enclosed space that can protect the pen from heat, moisture, and air.	0.006622516556291391	0.0	0.013245033112582781	0.039735099337748346	0.06622516556291391	0.006622516556291391	0.019867549668874173	0.2913907284768212	0.0728476821192053	0.0	0.07947019867549669	0.033112582781456956	0.1456953642384106	0.0	0.006622516556291391	151
1417	First, cutting in line is considered rude and disrespectful to those who have been waiting patiently. Therefore, a punishment should be given to discourage this behavior. Option A, auditorium, does not make sense in this context as it is a place for performances, not punishment. Option B, humans, is too vague and does not provide a clear punishment. Option C, opera house, is similar to option A and does not make sense in this context. Option D, death, is an extreme and inappropriate punishment for cutting in line. Option E, end of line, is a reasonable punishment as it requires the person who cut to go to the back of the line and wait their turn like everyone else. Therefore, the correct answer is E, end of line.	0.026490066225165563	0.0	0.0	0.039735099337748346	0.09271523178807947	0.0	0.039735099337748346	0.24503311258278146	0.09271523178807947	0.0	0.08609271523178808	0.059602649006622516	0.152317880794702	0.0	0.006622516556291391	151
1418	Success is usually a product of preparation and what? A. Awards ceremony - This option doesn't make sense as an awards ceremony is a celebration of success, not a factor that contributes to it.B. Various situations - This option is too vague and doesn't provide a clear answer. Success can come from different situations, but it doesn't necessarily mean that those situations are the cause of success.C. Vocation - This option is also too specific and doesn't apply to all cases. Success can come from any field or profession, not just one's vocation.D. Working hard - This option makes sense as hard work is often a key factor in achieving success. Preparation alone is not enough; one must also put in the effort to make their goals a reality.E. Promotion - This option doesn't make sense as promotion is a result of success, not a cause of it. One must first achieve success before being promoted.Therefore, the answer is D. Working hard.	0.005263157894736842	0.0	0.0	0.042105263157894736	0.1	0.005263157894736842	0.06842105263157895	0.22105263157894736	0.07894736842105263	0.005263157894736842	0.07368421052631578	0.042105263157894736	0.11578947368421053	0.0	0.02631578947368421	190
1419	First, we need to understand what an air conditioner is. An air conditioner is a device that cools and dehumidifies the air in a room or building. Next, we need to consider where it would be necessary to have cool and dehumidified air. A. An office building is a professional space where people work and often need a comfortable environment to be productive. Therefore, it is likely to have an air conditioner. B. Texas is a state known for its hot and humid climate, so it is likely that many professional spaces in Texas would have air conditioning. C. A house may or may not have an air conditioner, depending on the location and climate. D. Humid is not a professional space, but rather a description of the climate. E. Warm climates, like Texas, are likely to have air conditioning in professional spaces. Therefore, the answer is A. office building and B. Texas.	0.005813953488372093	0.0	0.011627906976744186	0.046511627906976744	0.11627906976744186	0.01744186046511628	0.03488372093023256	0.22093023255813954	0.040697674418604654	0.0	0.05813953488372093	0.09302325581395349	0.11046511627906977	0.0	0.046511627906976744	172
1420	The question is asking for the key to happiness while living life. Option A, existing, is not enough to bring happiness as it implies just being alive without any purpose or fulfillment. Option B, happiness, is not the key itself but rather the end goal. Option C, early death, is obviously not the answer as it goes against the premise of living life. Option D, acquiring knowledge, can bring happiness but it is not the only key to happiness. Therefore, the answer is E, being idle, as it implies not doing anything productive or meaningful which can lead to boredom and lack of purpose, ultimately leading to unhappiness. The key to happiness while living life is to do more than just being idle.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.04225352112676056	0.09154929577464789	0.014084507042253521	0.04225352112676056	0.2323943661971831	0.09859154929577464	0.0	0.09859154929577464	0.06338028169014084	0.13380281690140844	0.0	0.0	142
1421	Stopping being married to each other means the end of a relationship. This can bring grief, confusion, and depression for some people. However, it can also bring relief and happiness. Ending a marriage that is no longer working can be a beginning of a new chapter in life. It can bring the opportunity for personal growth, new experiences, and the chance to find a more compatible partner. It can also bring relief from the stress and unhappiness that may have been present in the marriage. Therefore, the correct answer is C. relief and E. happiness.	0.009259259259259259	0.0	0.0	0.046296296296296294	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.06481481481481481	0.2222222222222222	0.07407407407407407	0.0	0.08333333333333333	0.07407407407407407	0.12037037037037036	0.0	0.009259259259259259	108
1422	First, we know that James likes to hear Jenny doing something. This means that it's an activity that involves some kind of sound. Next, we know that they usually get home late, so it's likely that this activity takes place in the evening or at night. Finally, we know that Jenny is very smart, but that doesn't necessarily give us any clues about what James might like to hear her do. Based on these clues, the most likely answer is B. sing. Singing is an activity that involves sound, can be done in the evening or at night, and doesn't require any particular intelligence or knowledge. It's also a common activity that friends might do together, especially if they enjoy spending time together. A is also a possibility, but it's less likely because telling a story doesn't necessarily involve sound (unless it's a dramatic reading or something similar). C, D, and E are all unlikely because they don't involve sound or don't fit with the clues we have.	0.009950248756218905	0.0	0.024875621890547265	0.09950248756218906	0.10945273631840796	0.04477611940298507	0.07960199004975124	0.14925373134328357	0.03980099502487562	0.0	0.11442786069651742	0.04477611940298507	0.11442786069651742	0.0	0.04975124378109453	201

Freedom from want - Guilt can sometimes lead to a desire for material possessions or experiences to make up for past mistakes. Being free from guilt can lead to contentment with what one already has.C. Medal - This answer is not necessarily related to being free from guilt. One can achieve a medal for a variety of reasons, not just because they are free from guilt.D. Headache - This answer is unlikely as being free from guilt can actually relieve stress and tension, which can lead to fewer headaches.E. New computer - This answer is not necessarily related to being free from guilt.

1425	A space shuttle is not necessary for experiencing what it means to be human. A library and school are important for learning and education, but not necessarily for experiencing what it means to be human. A wife is a personal choice and not a requirement for experiencing what it means to be human. Therefore, the most likely answer is D. love. Love is a fundamental aspect of human experience, including love for oneself, others, and the world around us. Without experiencing love, Danny may be missing a crucial part of what it means to be human.	0.0	0.0	0.009259259259259259	0.09259259259259259	0.10185185185185185	0.0	0.027777777777777776	0.17592592592592593	0.08333333333333333	0.0	0.09259259259259259	0.10185185185185185	0.1111111111111111	0.0	0.027777777777777776	108

Additionally, having knowledge of the stock market and banking can also be helpful in understanding the financial aspects of buying and selling properties. So, C. Stock Market and E.

1437	First, we know that the man was convicted of a crime caused by his apathy. This means that he was not actively involved in preventing or stopping the crime, and may have even contributed to it through his inaction. Next, we know that he would spend at least a hundred hours finally doing something. This suggests that he was ordered by the court to perform some kind of community service or restitution for his crime. Now, we need to look at the answer choices to see which one fits best. A. Commercial: This doesn't seem to fit with the context of the sentence. It's possible that the man could be ordered to do some kind of commercial work as part of his community service, but there's no indication of that here. B. Three-toed: This is a reference to the sloth, which is known for being slow and lazy. However, it doesn't make sense as an answer choice. C. Civil service: This seems like the most likely answer. Civil service refers to work done for the government or community, often as part of a sentence for a crime. It would make sense for the man to be ordered to do civil service as part of his punishment. D. Paraguay: This doesn't fit with the context of the sentence at all. E. Costa Rica: This also doesn't fit with the context of the sentence. Therefore, the answer is C. Civil service.	0.043478260869565216	0.0	0.010869565217391304	0.06521739130434782	0.07971014492753623	0.018115942028985508	0.057971014492753624	0.18478260869565216	0.11231884057971014	0.0036231884057971015	0.10869565217391304	0.028985507246376812	0.10869565217391304	0.0	0.03260869565217391	276
1438	"First, the sentence states that ""they were all sitting down."" This implies that they are in a seated position. Next, the sentence says that they were ""getting comfortable."" This suggests that they are adjusting their position or posture in order to feel more at ease. Finally, the sentence concludes by stating that this doesn't always necessarily require a what. Based on this information, we can eliminate options A, C, and E, as they all suggest that some sort of action or object is required in order to sit comfortably. Option B, ""chair,"" is a possibility, as sitting in a chair can certainly be a comfortable way to sit. However, the sentence does not explicitly state that they are sitting in chairs. Option D, ""floor,"" is the best answer, as it suggests that they may be sitting directly on the ground or floor, without the need for any additional seating. This is a common way to sit in many cultures and situations, and can certainly be comfortable if done properly. Therefore, the correct answer is D, ""floor."""	0.023148148148148147	0.0	0.004629629629629629	0.05092592592592592	0.08796296296296297	0.041666666666666664	0.06481481481481481	0.1574074074074074	0.0787037037037037	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.041666666666666664	0.18055555555555555	0.0	0.004629629629629629	216

1451	Competing with others can be a high-pressure situation, so feeling stressed may not be the best emotion to have as it can lead to anxiety and decreased performance. Anger can also be counterproductive as it can cloud judgment and lead to impulsive decisions. Feeling defeated can also be detrimental as it can lead to giving up or not putting in the effort needed to succeed. On the other hand, feeling pumped or energized can be helpful as it can increase motivation and focus. Aggression, if channeled appropriately, can also be useful in a competitive setting as it can show assertiveness and determination. Therefore, the most useful emotion for getting an advantage when competing with others would be C. pumped or energized, followed by E. aggression if used in a controlled and focused manner.	0.06802721088435375	0.0	0.0	0.034013605442176874	0.1360544217687075	0.027210884353741496	0.04081632653061224	0.1564625850340136	0.11564625850340136	0.0	0.16326530612244897	0.08843537414965986	0.08843537414965986	0.0	0.013605442176870748	147

1457	The chief of police was answering questions as fast as possible. This suggests that there were a lot of questions being asked, and the chief was trying to keep up with them. Now, why would someone try to answer questions as fast as possible? One possibility is that they are trying to avoid something. Option A: Anger - It's possible that the chief was trying to avoid anger from the people asking the questions, but there's no clear indication of this in the sentence. Option B: Teaching - It's unlikely that the chief was trying to avoid teaching, as answering questions is a form of teaching. Option C: Confusion - It's possible that the chief was trying to avoid confusion, as answering questions quickly can help clarify things. Option D: Panic - This seems like a likely possibility.

1473	First, it's important to note that cats are generally very clean animals and prefer to use a litter box. However, if their litter box is full or dirty, they may seek out other options. A. Houseplant: It's possible that a cat may use a houseplant as a substitute for a litter box, especially if the plant's soil is similar in texture to litter. However, this is not a common behavior and most cats will avoid using plants as a bathroom.B. Bathtub: Cats may be attracted to the smooth surface of a bathtub and may use it as a substitute litter box. However, this is not a desirable behavior and can be difficult to clean up.C. Dumpsters: It's unlikely that a cat would seek out a dumpster as a bathroom option, as it's not a natural or safe environment for them.D. Urban neighborhood: Cats may be attracted to soft soil or sand in an urban environment, such as a garden or flower bed. However, this is not a desirable behavior and can cause damage to plants and property.E. Floor: If a cat cannot find a suitable alternative to their litter box, they may resort to using the floor. This is not a desirable behavior and can be difficult to clean up.Overall, the best solution is to ensure that the litter box is clean and accessible for the cat.

Finally, a library is a place where many books are stored, and therefore, it is likely to have a large volume of text. Therefore, the answer is E. library.	0.014925373134328358	0.0	0.0	0.05223880597014925	0.11194029850746269	0.014925373134328358	0.06716417910447761	0.23134328358208955	0.08955223880597014	0.007462686567164179	0.04477611940298507	0.06716417910447761	0.11194029850746269	0.0	0.007462686567164179	134
1479	In a trial, someone who provides information about what they have seen or heard related to the case is called a witness. Therefore, the answer is A. witness. B. testify and C. give testimony are also correct as they refer to the act of providing information as a witness. D. judge is incorrect as the judge presides over the trial and makes decisions based on the evidence presented, but does not take a stand to help a case.

1484	First, the work was done and it was a success. This means that the goal was achieved and the outcome was positive. Next, it was now time to do something to acknowledge and recognize this success. Option A, reproduce, does not make sense in this context as it is not related to celebrating success. Option B, jump around, could be a way to express excitement and joy, but it is not a formal way to celebrate success. Option C, have a party, is a common way to celebrate success. It involves gathering people together, having food and drinks, and enjoying each other's company. Option D, hear the crowd go mad, suggests that the success was achieved in front of an audience, and their reaction is being anticipated. However, it is not a way to celebrate success in itself. Option E, celebrate, is the most appropriate answer as it encompasses all the possible ways to acknowledge and recognize success.

1485	First, we need to understand what a steel cable is. It is a strong, flexible cable made of steel wires twisted together. Next, we need to understand what a tug is. A tug is a small, powerful boat used for towing larger vessels or objects. Now, the question asks what Steve would need in order to use the steel cable to pull the tug. Option A, a winch, is a device used for winding and unwinding a cable or rope, often used for pulling heavy objects. This seems like a plausible answer. Option B, a wrench, is a tool used for tightening or loosening bolts or nuts. This is not relevant to the question. Option C, a suspension bridge, is a type of bridge that hangs from cables suspended from towers. This is not relevant to the question. Option D, a factory, is a building where goods are manufactured or assembled. This is not relevant to the question. Option E, a ship, is a large vessel used for transportation on water.

1487	First, we need to understand what an inch measurement is. An inch is a unit of length commonly used in the United States and United Kingdom. Next, we need to determine which system of measurement the person needs to convert to. The options given are liquid measure, centimeter, centimetre, metric, and mile. Since we are dealing with length, we can eliminate liquid measure as an option. Centimeter and centimetre are the same unit of measurement, just spelled differently in different countries. They are both part of the metric system, so we can eliminate centimeter/centimetre as a separate option and include it under the metric system. Finally, we are left with two options: metric and mile. Since an inch is not commonly used in the mile system, the person would need to convert to the metric system. Therefore, the answer is D. metric.	0.029940119760479042	0.0	0.03592814371257485	0.05389221556886228	0.0718562874251497	0.017964071856287425	0.04790419161676647	0.20958083832335328	0.08383233532934131	0.005988023952095809	0.10179640718562874	0.0658682634730539	0.1377245508982036	0.0	0.0658682634730539	167

The next part of the sentence says ""they knew what each other would what?"" This means that they were able to anticipate each other's actions or needs. Option A, sending an email, is not relevant to the sentence as it does not relate to effective communication within a team. Option B, talking with people, is also not relevant as it does not specify who the team is talking to. Option C, ringing up the president of Bermuda, is completely unrelated to the sentence and is not a logical conclusion. Option D, thinking, is a possibility as effective communication often involves understanding each other's thought processes. Option E, speaking to, is also a possibility as effective communication involves being able to express oneself clearly to others.

1490	John is changing into shorts and sweat pants, which suggests that he is getting ready for some sort of physical activity or exercise. This rules out options C, D, and E, as they are not typically associated with physical activity. Next, we can consider the remaining options: gym and swimming pool. While both of these locations are associated with physical activity, the fact that John is changing into sweat pants suggests that he is preparing for a workout that will take place indoors, rather than in a pool. Therefore, the most likely answer is A. gym.	0.01818181818181818	0.0	0.00909090909090909	0.045454545454545456	0.08181818181818182	0.03636363636363636	0.045454545454545456	0.22727272727272727	0.10909090909090909	0.0	0.10909090909090909	0.045454545454545456	0.12727272727272726	0.0	0.01818181818181818	110

1493	First, after using an iron, it is important to turn it off and unplug it for safety. Then, the item that was ironed should be left to cool down for a few minutes before being put away. The most common place to put something after ironing it is on an ironing board. This is a flat surface designed specifically for ironing, with a heat-resistant cover and a place to hang clothes. Once the item has cooled down, it can be folded or hung up in a closet or laundry room. The linen closet is also a possible option if the item is a sheet or towel. The kitchen is not a suitable place to put something after ironing it, as it is not a designated area for laundry or clothing storage.	0.06164383561643835	0.0	0.0	0.0684931506849315	0.0958904109589041	0.0136986301369863	0.04794520547945205	0.19863013698630136	0.10273972602739725	0.0	0.11643835616438356	0.04794520547945205	0.0958904109589041	0.0	0.0136986301369863	146
1494	"The first part of the sentence states that they were ""more safe in the basement."" This implies that they were previously in a less safe location.

Option B, unprotected, could work, but it doesn't fully capture the idea that they were in danger. Option C, in danger, is a good choice because it directly states that they were at risk. Option D, dangerous, is incorrect because the weather itself was dangerous, but it didn't put them in a dangerous location. Option E, at risk, is also a good choice because it conveys the idea that they were in a potentially dangerous situation.

1502	First, we need to identify what a metal rod is. A metal rod is a long, thin, cylindrical piece of metal that can be used for various purposes. Next, we need to consider the contexts in which metal rods are commonly used. Welding involves joining two pieces of metal together using heat and pressure, and metal rods can be used as filler material in this process. Home improvement often involves building or repairing structures using metal components, and metal rods may be used as reinforcement or support. Manufacturing involves the production of goods using machinery and raw materials, and metal rods may be used as components in the manufacturing process. Based on these contexts, we can eliminate options A, D, and E, as broken bones, cars, and engines are not typically associated with the use of metal rods. That leaves us with options B and C. Construction sites and shops are both plausible contexts for the use of metal rods, but since the question mentions welding and manufacturing specifically, we can infer that option C, shops, is the most likely answer. Therefore, the correct answer is C. shops.	0.03255813953488372	0.0	0.023255813953488372	0.03255813953488372	0.07906976744186046	0.004651162790697674	0.04186046511627907	0.2930232558139535	0.07906976744186046	0.004651162790697674	0.11162790697674418	0.04186046511627907	0.12558139534883722	0.0	0.013953488372093023	215

1507	1. Determine the location of the religious experiences: Is it in a church, temple, mosque, or at home?2. Consider the frequency of the religious experiences: Are they held daily, weekly, monthly, or annually?3. Evaluate the space available: Is there a designated storage area for chairs or will they need to be stored in a multi-purpose space?4. Determine the type of folding chairs: Are they lightweight and easy to move or heavy-duty and require more space?Based on these considerations, the answer could vary. If the religious experiences are held in a church or temple, it may be best to store the folding chairs in a designated closet or room within the building. If the experiences are held at home, the chairs could be stored in a closet or room specifically designated for religious items. If space is limited, the chairs could be stored in a basement or garage.

This means that the snake is most likely to be found in its natural habitat, which eliminates options B, C, and E. Next, we need to consider the type of environment that snakes typically inhabit. Snakes are cold-blooded and require warmth to regulate their body temperature, so they are most commonly found in warm, tropical environments. This eliminates option A, as not all natural environments are warm and tropical. Therefore, the correct answer is D. A snake is most likely to be encountered while out in a tropical forest, where it can find the warmth and shelter it needs to survive.	0.022058823529411766	0.0	0.014705882352941176	0.058823529411764705	0.07352941176470588	0.03676470588235294	0.058823529411764705	0.17647058823529413	0.04411764705882353	0.0	0.11764705882352941	0.09558823529411764	0.11764705882352941	0.0	0.022058823529411766	136
1522	First, we need to consider that movies are often made in locations that are easily accessible and have a lot of infrastructure for filming. Second, we need to consider that subway stations are often used in movies to create a sense of urgency or to show characters rushing to catch a train. With these factors in mind, the most likely answer is B. New York. New York City has a vast subway system that is easily accessible for filming, and it is a popular location for movies and TV shows. Additionally, the iconic yellow subway cars and bustling stations are often used to create a sense of urgency or to show characters navigating a busy city.	0.023809523809523808	0.0	0.015873015873015872	0.03968253968253968	0.07142857142857142	0.015873015873015872	0.07142857142857142	0.2222222222222222	0.07936507936507936	0.0	0.11904761904761904	0.07142857142857142	0.07936507936507936	0.0	0.031746031746031744	126
1523	First, you need ears to physically hear the testimony. However, just having ears is not enough. You also need to engage in careful listening to fully understand the testimony. This means paying attention to the words being spoken, the tone of voice, and any nonverbal cues. Additionally, having a change of heart is not necessary to understand testimony. Finally, sleepiness can actually hinder your ability to understand testimony. Therefore, the correct answer is B. careful listening.	0.011111111111111112	0.0	0.0	0.03333333333333333	0.05555555555555555	0.0	0.1111111111111111	0.18888888888888888	0.044444444444444446	0.0	0.14444444444444443	0.06666666666666667	0.15555555555555556	0.0	0.022222222222222223	90
1524	"First, all the students had to gather for the announcement. This means they were in one place. Then, the announcement wrapped up, which means it ended. So, what would the students do after the announcement ended? They would likely leave the gathering place and go their separate ways. The word that best fits this description is ""disperse.""

1525	First, we need to understand why someone might get a wound from lying in bed. This is called a pressure ulcer or bed sore, which can occur when someone is immobile for long periods of time and pressure is placed on certain areas of the body, such as the back, hips, and heels. With this in mind, we can eliminate options C, D, and E as they are not directly related to the situation of lying in bed for extended periods of time. Option B, the hospital, could potentially be responsible for preventing pressure ulcers in patients, but they themselves would not end up with a wound. Therefore, the correct answer is A, the patient, as they are the ones who are at risk for developing pressure ulcers if they are not repositioned or given proper care while lying in bed.	0.03125	0.0	0.0125	0.0625	0.0875	0.025	0.03125	0.225	0.14375	0.0	0.1	0.05	0.11875	0.0	0.00625	160
1526	First, water needs to be cooled down to a temperature below its freezing point, which is 0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit. As the temperature drops, the water molecules start to move more slowly and come closer together. Next, the water molecules start to form a crystalline structure, which is the beginning of ice formation. The molecules arrange themselves in a specific pattern, with each molecule bonded to four neighboring molecules in a hexagonal shape. As more and more water molecules join the crystal structure, the ice grows and becomes more solid. Eventually, the entire volume of water will freeze into a solid block of ice. So the answer is E. Water becomes ice by forming crystals as it cools down below its freezing point.	0.014184397163120567	0.0	0.0	0.028368794326241134	0.03546099290780142	0.0	0.06382978723404255	0.24822695035460993	0.12056737588652482	0.02127659574468085	0.12056737588652482	0.06382978723404255	0.10638297872340426	0.0	0.04964539007092199	141
1527	Sarah wanted to surprise her husband with a trip. The question is asking what her husband had already done regarding the trip that caused the surprise to fail. Option A, predictable, doesn't really fit because it doesn't explain what the husband had already done. Option B, known about, is a possibility. If the husband already knew about the trip, then the surprise would be ruined. Option C, bland, doesn't really make sense in this context. Option D, bought tickets, seems like a strong possibility. If the husband had already bought tickets for the trip, then the surprise would be ruined. Option E, sneaky, doesn't really fit because it's describing Sarah's actions, not her husband's. So the answer is most likely D, bought tickets.	0.09090909090909091	0.0	0.0	0.05194805194805195	0.09740259740259741	0.025974025974025976	0.07142857142857142	0.19480519480519481	0.03896103896103896	0.0	0.13636363636363635	0.025974025974025976	0.15584415584415584	0.0	0.012987012987012988	154
1528	First, we know that the police officer is in their sixties, which means they are likely nearing retirement age. So, option A, retire, is a possible answer. However, just because an officer is in their sixties doesn't necessarily mean they have retired yet. They may still be working and performing their duties. Option B, directing traffic, is a possible duty for a police officer of any age. Option C, casing, is a bit vague and could refer to a variety of investigative tasks. It's possible that a police officer in their sixties could still be involved in investigative work. Option D, fining someone for speeding, is also a possible duty for a police officer of any age. Option E, ordering someone to stop running, is a bit specific and may not be a common duty for a police officer. Overall, the most likely answer is A, retire, but it's important to remember that police officers can continue to work and perform their duties well into their sixties and beyond.	0.010050251256281407	0.0	0.005025125628140704	0.07035175879396985	0.10552763819095477	0.020100502512562814	0.06030150753768844	0.23618090452261306	0.07035175879396985	0.0	0.09045226130653267	0.06030150753768844	0.135678391959799	0.0	0.02512562814070352	199
1529	First, we need to consider what qualities make a place good for an automobile. Some possible factors could include safety, accessibility, maintenance, and convenience.A garage and driveway are both good options because they provide a safe and secure place for the automobile to be stored. They also offer easy access for the owner to get in and out of the vehicle.A repair shop is also a good place for an automobile because it allows for maintenance and repairs to be done by professionals. This can help keep the vehicle in good condition and prevent breakdowns.A junk yard, on the other hand, is not a good place for an automobile because it implies that the vehicle is no longer in working condition and has been discarded.An exit ramp is not a good place for an automobile because it is a busy and potentially dangerous area where accidents can occur.Therefore, the best answer is A. garage or B. driveway.	0.02247191011235955	0.0	0.0056179775280898875	0.03932584269662921	0.07865168539325842	0.033707865168539325	0.03932584269662921	0.24719101123595505	0.07865168539325842	0.0	0.0898876404494382	0.07865168539325842	0.0898876404494382	0.0	0.016853932584269662	178
1530	The first goal of a poor person having food is to not starve, as they need sustenance to survive. Once they have enough food to meet their basic needs, the next goal would be to be full, as this would provide them with energy and help them feel satisfied. The goal is not to get fat, as this is not a priority for someone who is struggling to meet their basic needs. Therefore, the best answer is D. survive.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.09090909090909091	0.11363636363636363	0.011363636363636364	0.011363636363636364	0.14772727272727273	0.06818181818181818	0.0	0.125	0.11363636363636363	0.10227272727272728	0.0	0.022727272727272728	88
1531	First, we know that the person didn't know a blowfish was edible. This means that they probably didn't expect to see it in a place where food is sold or served. Option A, desert, doesn't make sense because blowfish are not typically found in deserts. Option B, sea water, also doesn't make sense because blowfish are found in the ocean, but the person wouldn't be surprised to see it in its natural habitat. Option C, fish market, seems like the most likely answer. If the person saw the blowfish for sale at a fish market, they might be surprised to learn that it's edible. Option D, books, doesn't make sense because the person wouldn't see the blowfish in a book. Option E, France, doesn't provide enough context to determine if it's a likely answer or not. Therefore, the answer is C. fish market.	0.045454545454545456	0.0	0.005681818181818182	0.045454545454545456	0.10227272727272728	0.05113636363636364	0.03409090909090909	0.2159090909090909	0.045454545454545456	0.0	0.10795454545454546	0.045454545454545456	0.13068181818181818	0.0	0.017045454545454544	176
1532	A. Furniture store - People may see tables in a furniture store, but they don't usually have them there.B. Kitchen - Many people have a table in their kitchen, but not everyone.C. Dining room - This is the most common place for people to have a table.D. Bathroom - It's not common for people to have a table in their bathroom.E. Conference - People may have a table in a conference room, but it's not a typical location for a table in a personal or residential setting.Therefore, the answer is C. dining room.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.06306306306306306	0.10810810810810811	0.0	0.036036036036036036	0.23423423423423423	0.07207207207207207	0.0	0.009009009009009009	0.05405405405405406	0.13513513513513514	0.0	0.036036036036036036	111
1533	Sally wants to keep her saltshaker where she can find it but where it would be out of the way. Option A: Dinner table - This might not be the best option as it could get in the way of plates and other dinnerware.Option B: Table setting - This is also not the best option as it is usually reserved for plates, utensils, and glasses.Option C: Own kitchen - This is a possibility, but it doesn't specify where in the kitchen.Option D: Kitchen counter - This could be a good option as it is easily accessible and visible.Option E: Cabinet - This could also be a good option as it is out of the way but still easily accessible.Based on the options given, the best answer would be either D or E, depending on Sally's personal preference.	0.018633540372670808	0.0	0.0	0.055900621118012424	0.11180124223602485	0.018633540372670808	0.037267080745341616	0.2236024844720497	0.08695652173913043	0.0	0.055900621118012424	0.06832298136645963	0.13664596273291926	0.0	0.012422360248447204	161
1534	First, we need to go high enough so that we are above the clouds and any tall buildings or mountains. A balloon could take us up to a certain height, but it would not be high enough to be completely out of sight. A house or supermarket would not be able to lift us off the ground at all. Next, we need to reach a high enough altitude where we are above the atmosphere and into space. A space shuttle or rocket would be able to achieve this, but they are expensive and require specialized training to operate. Therefore, the best answer would be E. rocket. A rocket can reach high enough altitudes to be completely out of sight from Earth.	0.0	0.0	0.045112781954887216	0.06015037593984962	0.11278195488721804	0.022556390977443608	0.07518796992481203	0.15789473684210525	0.08270676691729323	0.0	0.07518796992481203	0.09022556390977443	0.09022556390977443	0.0	0.015037593984962405	133

1536	People who act quirky and abnormal may be seen as different from the norm, which could lead to them being described as strange or odd. However, it is important to note that these descriptions are subjective and can vary depending on the individual's perspective. It would not be fair or accurate to describe them as stupid, as intelligence is not necessarily related to behavior or personality traits. Kindness is also not necessarily related to quirks or abnormal behavior, so it would not be an appropriate description either. Therefore, the best answer is either C. odd or E. strange.	0.03669724770642202	0.0	0.0	0.05504587155963303	0.12844036697247707	0.01834862385321101	0.06422018348623854	0.13761467889908258	0.07339449541284404	0.0	0.09174311926605505	0.13761467889908258	0.09174311926605505	0.0	0.009174311926605505	109
1537	First, we need to consider the behavior of a weasel. Weasels are known for their agility, speed, and hunting skills. They are also known for their ability to squeeze through small spaces and burrow underground. Next, we need to consider the potential for destruction in each of the given locations. A. Beach - A loose weasel on a beach would likely not cause much destruction. Weasels are not adapted to aquatic environments and would likely avoid the water. They may hunt small rodents or birds on the beach, but this would not cause significant destruction. B. Michigan - Michigan is a large state with a variety of environments, so it's difficult to say where a weasel would cause the most destruction. However, we can assume that a weasel would be more likely to cause destruction in a rural or suburban area where there are more potential prey items (such as rabbits, squirrels, or chickens). C. Great Britain - Weasels are native to Great Britain and are found throughout the country. However, they are not typically considered a major pest or threat to human activity. D. Hen house - This is the most likely answer. Weasels are known for their ability to kill multiple prey items in a short amount of time, and they are notorious for attacking chicken coops. A loose weasel in a hen house could potentially kill all of the chickens, causing significant destruction to a farmer's livelihood. E. Forrest - A loose weasel in a forest would likely not cause much destruction. Weasels are adapted to hunting in open fields and grasslands, and would not have as much success in a densely wooded area. They may hunt small rodents or birds, but this would not cause significant destruction. Therefore, the answer is D. Hen house.	0.026865671641791045	0.0	0.008955223880597015	0.03880597014925373	0.08358208955223881	0.011940298507462687	0.050746268656716415	0.20597014925373133	0.08358208955223881	0.0	0.08955223880597014	0.08656716417910448	0.11940298507462686	0.0	0.023880597014925373	335
1538	First, we need to identify the potential sources of dirt on a farm. These could include mud, manure, dirt, and dust. Next, we need to consider what actions could be taken to protect the legs from getting dirty. A. Wearing jeans is a good option as they provide a barrier between the legs and the dirt. B. Milking a cow may not necessarily protect the legs from getting dirty, but it is a task that may need to be done on a farm. C. Believing in god is not relevant to protecting one's legs from getting dirty on a farm. D. Avoiding mud may be difficult on a farm, but wearing boots or other protective footwear can help. E. Planting flowers is not relevant to protecting one's legs from getting dirty on a farm. Therefore, the best answer is A. wear jeans.	0.012422360248447204	0.0	0.012422360248447204	0.049689440993788817	0.08695652173913043	0.0	0.024844720496894408	0.19875776397515527	0.09316770186335403	0.0	0.13043478260869565	0.07453416149068323	0.10559006211180125	0.0	0.043478260869565216	161
1539	First, it is important to note that not all men will have the same reaction. However, based on societal norms and expectations, the most common answer would be B. erections.

1540	The question is asking what is left of the ancient giant lizards. The first part of the answer states that fossils are left, which is true. The second part of the answer needs to be something that is also left behind after the lizards have gone extinct. Option A, four legs, is not a correct answer because many animals have four legs and it does not specifically relate to the ancient giant lizards. Option B, sex to produce offspring, is not a correct answer because it is a biological process that is not specific to the ancient giant lizards. Option C, pictures, is not a correct answer because pictures are not a physical remnant of the ancient giant lizards. Option D, bones, is a correct answer because fossils are essentially the preserved bones of the ancient giant lizards. Option E, tail, is not a correct answer because it is a body part that is included in the fossils/bones that are already mentioned in the first part of the answer.

If the animal was a wild animal that entered the property on its own, then it may be difficult to assign fault to any specific party. Overall, the most likely answer is C. Home or office, as the responsibility for maintaining and repairing the carpeting falls on the owner or occupant of the property. However, the specific circumstances of the situation may impact who is ultimately responsible for the damage.	0.04294478527607362	0.0	0.012269938650306749	0.0736196319018405	0.09815950920245399	0.024539877300613498	0.05521472392638037	0.1901840490797546	0.07975460122699386	0.0	0.09202453987730061	0.06748466257668712	0.09202453987730061	0.0	0.012269938650306749	163

1563	When you exercise vigorously, your body uses energy to power your muscles. This energy comes from the food you eat, so you may feel a need for food after exercising. As your body works harder, it generates heat, which causes you to sweat. Sweating helps regulate your body temperature and prevent overheating. Additionally, when you exercise, you put stress on your muscles, which causes tiny tears in the muscle fibers. As your body repairs these tears, your muscles grow stronger and more defined. This process is called muscle hypertrophy, and it is what allows you to build muscle mass. Over time, regular exercise can also improve your overall fitness level, making it easier to perform physical tasks and activities. Finally, as you sweat and lose fluids during exercise, you may feel thirsty and need to drink water to stay hydrated. So, the correct answer is: C. muscles.	0.011627906976744186	0.0	0.0	0.12209302325581395	0.03488372093023256	0.011627906976744186	0.046511627906976744	0.20930232558139536	0.05813953488372093	0.0	0.18604651162790697	0.05813953488372093	0.14534883720930233	0.0	0.0	172

1565	"First, we need to identify what ""surprising strike"" means. A strike is typically a work stoppage or protest by employees, but if it is surprising, it suggests that it was unexpected or sudden. Next, we need to consider the options given. A and C (funny and humor) don't make sense in the context of a strike. B (frightened) could potentially be a reason for a strike, but it doesn't fit with the idea of a surprising strike. D (fight) could be a reason for a strike, but it doesn't necessarily imply surprise. That leaves us with E (labor problems), which is the most logical answer. A surprising strike could be caused by unexpected labor issues or disputes between employees and management. Therefore, the answer is E."	0.01935483870967742	0.0	0.01935483870967742	0.05806451612903226	0.09032258064516129	0.012903225806451613	0.04516129032258064	0.21935483870967742	0.06451612903225806	0.0	0.07096774193548387	0.06451612903225806	0.16774193548387098	0.0	0.0064516129032258064	155
1566	First, we need to consider the high elevation and lack of buildings. This suggests that we are likely in a mountainous or wilderness area. Next, we need to consider the options given. A. Doing a crossword puzzle may be a good option for some, but it doesn't take advantage of the unique environment we are in. B. Going skiing could be a great option if there are slopes nearby, but it's not always feasible or accessible. C. Playing games could be a good option, but it depends on what kind of games are available and if you have someone to play with. D. Hanging out at a bar is not a good option if there are no buildings around. E. Sleeping is a good option if you're tired, but it doesn't cure boredom. Based on these considerations, the best answer is likely C. Playing games can be a fun and engaging way to pass the time, and there are many games that can be played outdoors or with minimal equipment. Some examples could include card games, board games, or even simple games like tag or hide-and-seek.	0.014018691588785047	0.0	0.018691588785046728	0.07009345794392523	0.11682242990654206	0.02336448598130841	0.03271028037383177	0.18691588785046728	0.06074766355140187	0.0	0.08878504672897196	0.08878504672897196	0.102803738317757	0.0	0.014018691588785047	214
1567	First, we need to consider the behavior of snakes. Many snakes are ambush predators, meaning they wait in a hidden location for prey to come within striking distance. Option A, a burlap sack, is not a natural environment for a snake to hide in. Option B, a closet, may provide some hiding spots, but it is not a typical habitat for snakes. Option C, pet shops, may have snakes, but they are not hiding there to ambush prey. Option D, a hot country, is a broad category and does not necessarily provide information about where a snake would hide. Option E, deep grass, is the most likely answer. Snakes often hide in tall grass or vegetation to wait for prey to come by. This provides cover and allows them to blend in with their surroundings. Therefore, the correct answer is E, deep grass.	0.0	0.0	0.005917159763313609	0.03550295857988166	0.07100591715976332	0.005917159763313609	0.03550295857988166	0.23668639053254437	0.07692307692307693	0.0	0.10059171597633136	0.07692307692307693	0.15384615384615385	0.0	0.005917159763313609	169
1568	The sentence mentions that lights were installed in order to attract visitors. This suggests that the lights were installed in a place where visitors would be likely to go. Option A, carnival, is a possibility as carnivals often have lights to attract visitors. Option B, plane, is unlikely as planes typically have lights for safety reasons rather than to attract visitors. Option C, yacht, is also unlikely as yachts are typically used for private purposes rather than as a place to attract visitors. Option D, turned at night, is not a location but rather a description of when the lights were used. Option E, building, is a possibility as buildings often have lights to attract visitors, especially if they are tourist attractions or landmarks.

1571	First, we need to understand what a shiny advertisement is. It could refer to an advertisement that has a glossy or reflective finish, or it could refer to an advertisement that is eye-catching and attention-grabbing. Based on this, the most likely places to find a shiny advertisement would be A. magazine or D. bus. Magazines often have glossy pages and advertisements, while buses often have large, colorful advertisements that are designed to catch people's attention as they pass by. B. email and C. store are also possible options, as some email advertisements may have flashy graphics or animations, and some stores may have shiny or reflective signs or displays. However, these options are less likely than A and D.

1573	The American Civil War was a conflict between the Northern states (Union) and the Southern states (Confederacy) that lasted from 1861 to 1865. The main cause of the war was the disagreement over the issue of slavery. The Southern states wanted to keep slavery legal, while the Northern states wanted to abolish it. Therefore, the American Civil War was fought to free people from slavery, which is option E.	0.08860759493670886	0.0	0.0	0.02531645569620253	0.05063291139240506	0.012658227848101266	0.012658227848101266	0.17721518987341772	0.10126582278481013	0.02531645569620253	0.0759493670886076	0.08860759493670886	0.12658227848101267	0.0	0.06329113924050633	79

1575	First, you need to consider what you are trying to prevent the nails from damaging. If it's a surface like a wall or floor, you could use a protective covering like a drop cloth or painter's tape. If it's a delicate object like a piece of furniture, you could use a piece of cardboard or foam to cushion the impact of the hammer.If you want to prevent the nails from damaging other things while they are not in use, you could store them in a container or cabinet specifically designed for nails and other small hardware. This will keep them organized and prevent them from spilling out and causing damage.If you are building something like a doghouse, you can use clamps or other tools to hold the pieces in place while you hammer the nails. This will prevent the nails from slipping and causing damage to nearby objects.Overall, the best way to prevent nails from damaging other things nearby is to be careful and take precautions. Use protective coverings, store them properly, and use tools to hold things in place while you work.	0.009708737864077669	0.0	0.0	0.09223300970873786	0.06310679611650485	0.03398058252427184	0.024271844660194174	0.20388349514563106	0.09223300970873786	0.0	0.16019417475728157	0.05339805825242718	0.0825242718446602	0.0	0.0048543689320388345	206
1576	When washing clothes manually, one needs to add water and soap to the clothes. So, option A is correct. Singing or watching TV may be done while washing clothes, but it is not a direct result of washing clothes manually. Similarly, there is no connection between washing clothes manually and taking a train. Getting wet may happen while washing clothes manually, but it is not a necessary outcome. Therefore, the correct answer is A. water and soap.	0.011235955056179775	0.0	0.0	0.0449438202247191	0.0898876404494382	0.033707865168539325	0.07865168539325842	0.24719101123595505	0.033707865168539325	0.0	0.11235955056179775	0.056179775280898875	0.1348314606741573	0.0	0.0	89
1577	"First, we know that there were emergency vehicles present. This suggests that there was some sort of emergency or crisis situation. Option D, ""moving,"" doesn't really make sense in this context, as it doesn't explain why there were emergency vehicles present. Option E, ""airplane,"" also seems unlikely, as emergency vehicles are typically not called to respond to airplane-related incidents unless there is a crash or other serious incident. Option C, ""tunnel vision,"" is a medical condition and wouldn't typically result in emergency vehicles being present. That leaves us with options A and B. A traffic accident is a common reason for emergency vehicles to be present, as they are often called to respond to accidents and provide medical assistance. Option B, a tension headache, is unlikely to be the cause of emergency vehicles being present. Therefore, the most likely answer is A, a traffic accident."	0.033707865168539325	0.0	0.011235955056179775	0.0449438202247191	0.09550561797752809	0.02247191011235955	0.0449438202247191	0.25280898876404495	0.06179775280898876	0.0	0.07865168539325842	0.07303370786516854	0.16292134831460675	0.0	0.0056179775280898875	178
1578	First, we need to identify what type of environment requires a calm and productive carpet. A building, floor, bowling alley, office, and church are all possible options, but some are more likely than others. A bowling alley, for example, might prioritize durability and resistance to spills over calmness and productivity. A church might prioritize aesthetics and tradition over productivity. That leaves us with building, floor, and office as the most likely options. Out of those three, an office seems like the best fit for a calm and productive carpet. Therefore, the answer is D. office.	0.0	0.0	0.017543859649122806	0.017543859649122806	0.043859649122807015	0.0	0.03508771929824561	0.2807017543859649	0.10526315789473684	0.008771929824561403	0.06140350877192982	0.07017543859649122	0.16666666666666666	0.0	0.02631578947368421	114

1582	If you're suffering from hunger, the first thing you're likely to do is find food. Once you have your meal, you would probably eat it quickly to satisfy your hunger. Therefore, the correct answer is C. eat quickly. Ordering food or spending money may be necessary to obtain the meal, but they are not the immediate actions taken when suffering from hunger. Beginning work or having lunch may not be possible until the hunger is satisfied.	0.011494252873563218	0.0	0.0	0.09195402298850575	0.14942528735632185	0.034482758620689655	0.04597701149425287	0.1724137931034483	0.034482758620689655	0.0	0.12643678160919541	0.08045977011494253	0.10344827586206896	0.0	0.0	87
1583	First, we need to understand what a marmot is. A marmot is a type of ground squirrel that is typically found in mountainous regions. Next, we need to consider the options given. A marmot is unlikely to be found in a zoo or jungle, as these are not their natural habitats. An encyclopedia may provide information about marmots, but it is not a location where one would be found. This leaves us with the options of countryside and great plains. While marmots are not typically found in the great plains, they could potentially be found in the countryside, particularly in areas with hills or mountains. Therefore, the most likely answer is D. countryside.	0.046875	0.0	0.0234375	0.0703125	0.109375	0.015625	0.0625	0.203125	0.0859375	0.0	0.09375	0.046875	0.1171875	0.0	0.015625	128
1584	First, we know that the object in question is a television. Next, we know that it is used at night. This narrows down the possible locations, as a television used at night is likely to be in a place where people sleep. Option A, cabinet, is a possibility, but it doesn't necessarily imply that people sleep in the same room as the television. Option B, house, is too broad and doesn't give us any information about where in the house the television might be. Option C, apartment, is similar to option B in that it doesn't give us any specific information about where the television might be. Option D, bedroom, seems like the most likely answer, as it is a place where people sleep and where a television might be used at night for entertainment or relaxation. Option E, woods, is unlikely as it is not a typical location for a television, especially one that is used at night.

1586	First, the human should try to find a place with people around, such as a workplace or a restroom, where they can ask for help or call the police. If that is not possible, they could try to hide in a cornfield or any other nearby vegetation, but this may not provide enough cover. Star Trek and space are not realistic options for hiding from someone chasing you in the Midwest.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.05063291139240506	0.0759493670886076	0.02531645569620253	0.02531645569620253	0.1518987341772152	0.08860759493670886	0.0	0.11392405063291139	0.0759493670886076	0.10126582278481013	0.0	0.0379746835443038	79
1587	"First, we need to acknowledge that growing up poor does not guarantee any particular outcome. However, it is possible for someone to overcome their circumstances and achieve success in various ways. Option A, ""rich,"" is a possibility. With hard work, determination, and perhaps a bit of luck, someone who grew up poor could become wealthy through entrepreneurship, investing, or climbing the corporate ladder. Option B, ""good,"" is subjective and open to interpretation. It's possible for someone to grow up poor and become a kind, compassionate, and morally upright person, regardless of their financial status. Option C, ""being rich,"" is similar to option A and also a possibility. Option D, ""adequate,"" is a bit vague and doesn't necessarily imply success or achievement. It's possible for someone to grow up poor and end up living a comfortable, stable life, but this may not be considered a ""success"" by everyone. Option E, ""famous,"" is also a possibility, although it's worth noting that fame does not necessarily equate to success or happiness. Someone who grew up poor could become famous through talent, hard work, or luck, but this may not be the ultimate goal for everyone. In summary, the most accurate answer is A, ""rich,"" but it's important to recognize that success can take many forms and is not guaranteed for anyone, regardless of their background."	0.014134275618374558	0.0	0.0035335689045936395	0.06713780918727916	0.0812720848056537	0.014134275618374558	0.038869257950530034	0.1519434628975265	0.07773851590106007	0.0	0.0812720848056537	0.12367491166077739	0.1978798586572438	0.0	0.0035335689045936395	283
1588	First, we need to understand what kind of beads are being referred to. If it's Mardi Gras beads, then the answer would be E. New Orleans, as it is a popular tradition during the Mardi Gras festival to throw beads from balconies. However, if it's just regular crafting beads, then the answer could be C. Craft store, as many craft stores sell beads and someone could potentially be on a balcony outside of a craft store. The other options, A. Opera house and D. Theater, do not seem relevant to the context of getting beads on a balcony. Option B.

1589	First, the jury would need to determine if the person is guilty of the crime of killing. If they find the person guilty, then they would move on to decide on a sentence. A. Execution: This would only be a possible sentence if the crime was committed in a state that allows for the death penalty and if the jury decides to recommend it. However, not all states have the death penalty, and even in states that do, juries may choose to sentence the person to life in prison instead.B. Investigation: The trial is already the investigation phase, so this is not a possible decision for the jury.C. Going to jail: This is a likely sentence if the person is found guilty of killing. The length of the sentence would depend on the circumstances of the crime and the laws of the state.D. Retribution: This is not a specific sentence option, but it could be a factor in the jury's decision-making process. Retribution refers to the idea of punishing the person for their crime as a form of justice.E. Punishment: Going to jail would be a form of punishment, but there are other possible sentences as well, such as probation or community service. The jury would need to weigh the severity of the crime and the person's criminal history when deciding on an appropriate punishment. Therefore, the most likely answer is C. going to jail.	0.011111111111111112	0.0	0.0	0.02962962962962963	0.08148148148148149	0.025925925925925925	0.040740740740740744	0.23333333333333334	0.1037037037037037	0.0	0.08518518518518518	0.04814814814814815	0.1037037037037037	0.0	0.014814814814814815	270
1590	First, we need to consider safety. A butcher knife is a sharp and potentially dangerous tool, so it should be kept in a place where it won't accidentally harm anyone. A. A fishing boat may not be the best place to keep a butcher knife, as it could easily slide around and cause injury while the boat is in motion. B. Keeping a butcher knife in a backpack could also be risky, as it could accidentally cut through the backpack and harm the person carrying it. C. A shelf could be a good option if it's out of reach of children and pets, and the knife is stored in a protective sheath or cover. D. Keeping a butcher knife in a pocket is not recommended, as it could easily fall out and cause injury. E. The best answer is E. A kitchen drawer is a common and safe place to store a butcher knife, as long as it's kept in a designated slot or block and not loose among other utensils.

Option B, learn things, is a strong possibility as it aligns with the purpose of teaching. Option C, play games, could be a part of the teaching process, but it is not the main goal.

Finally, we know that the ficus is currently waiting outside in something. Based on this information, we can eliminate options A, C, D, and E because they don't provide any indication of what the ficus is in. That leaves us with option B, a large pot, as the most likely answer. It makes sense that Billy would have put the ficus in a pot to transport it and that it would be waiting outside in the pot until he figures out where to put it.

1610	A solicitor could buy a house, but this would not necessarily gain revenue for their legal practice. Claiming compensation on behalf of a client could potentially bring in revenue, as the solicitor may take a percentage of the compensation awarded. Writing a letter could also bring in revenue, as the solicitor may charge a fee for their time and expertise in drafting the letter. Charging according to time is a common practice for solicitors, where they bill clients for the time spent on their case. This can bring in significant revenue for the legal practice. Going to court is another way a solicitor could gain revenue, as they may charge a fee for representing their client in court. Therefore, the correct answer is: B. claim compensation, C. write letter, D. charge according to time, and E. go to court.	0.01282051282051282	0.0	0.0	0.038461538461538464	0.07692307692307693	0.00641025641025641	0.02564102564102564	0.26282051282051283	0.14102564102564102	0.0	0.1346153846153846	0.03205128205128205	0.10897435897435898	0.0	0.01282051282051282	156

1614	The sentence mentions a beauty salon, so we know that's where she is. The sentence also mentions people coming and going to different shops, so we know that the beauty salon is located near other shops. The options given are: picking clothes, clerk, strip mall, beautifying hair, and neighborhood. Option A, picking clothes, doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence. Option B, clerk, doesn't provide any information about the location of the beauty salon. Option C, strip mall, fits the context of the sentence perfectly. A strip mall is a shopping center with multiple stores, so it makes sense that people would be coming and going to different shops while she's at the beauty salon. Option D, beautifying hair, is mentioned in the sentence but doesn't provide any information about the location of the beauty salon. Option E, neighborhood, doesn't fit the context of the sentence. While the beauty salon may be located in a neighborhood, the sentence specifically mentions people coming and going to different shops, which implies a shopping area like a strip mall.

Option C, charming, is another possibility as it implies the agent has a likable and persuasive personality. Option D, deceive, does not fit as it suggests the agent is using dishonesty or trickery to get people to do things, which is not necessarily the case. Option E, cover up, does not fit at all as it implies the agent is hiding something or trying to keep something secret, which is not relevant to the scenario given.

1630	An expressway is a high-speed road designed for fast travel. Therefore, it is unlikely to be used in a medium or country area where there is less traffic and fewer destinations. The eastern United States has many large cities with heavy traffic, making it a possible location for expressways. Michigan is a state in the United States, so it is not a location where a person would use an expressway. Therefore, the most likely answer is D.

1633	First, we need to find a country with a constitutional monarchy. This means that the head of state is a monarch, but their powers are limited by a constitution. Examples of countries with constitutional monarchies include the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Japan.Next, we need to find a country with a parliamentary democracy. This means that the government is elected by the people and is accountable to the parliament. Examples of countries with parliamentary democracies include Canada, Australia, and Germany.Finally, we need to find a country that is a federation. This means that power is shared between a central government and regional governments. Examples of federations include the United States, Canada, and Australia.Putting all of these criteria together, we can see that Canada fits the bill. Canada has a constitutional monarchy with Queen Elizabeth II as the head of state, a parliamentary democracy with a Prime Minister and elected representatives, and a federation with power shared between the federal government and provincial governments.	0.026455026455026454	0.0	0.021164021164021163	0.031746031746031744	0.042328042328042326	0.021164021164021163	0.021164021164021163	0.19047619047619047	0.10052910052910052	0.0	0.10582010582010581	0.0582010582010582	0.12698412698412698	0.0	0.06878306878306878	189

1636	First, we need to understand what a mall is. A mall is a large shopping center with many stores and restaurants. Next, we need to consider where such a large shopping center would be located. It would require a lot of space, so it is unlikely to be found in a downtown area where space is limited. It is also unlikely to be found in a backyard, as it would be too large and noisy for a residential area. Montana is a state in the United States and not a location that would be relevant to this question. That leaves us with two options: suburbs or a large city. While malls can be found in both locations, they are more commonly found in the suburbs where there is more space for large shopping centers. Therefore, the answer is D. suburbs.	0.03205128205128205	0.0	0.019230769230769232	0.07051282051282051	0.1282051282051282	0.02564102564102564	0.04487179487179487	0.1858974358974359	0.07692307692307693	0.00641025641025641	0.07051282051282051	0.08333333333333333	0.10256410256410256	0.0	0.03205128205128205	156

1639	First, we know that the horse wanted to be free, so it's unlikely that it would go to a place where it would be confined or restrained, such as a circus or parade. Next, we can eliminate options that are too far away or unlikely for a horse to reach on its own, such as Canada or the movies. That leaves us with option D, countryside, as the most likely answer. Horses are known to enjoy open spaces and nature, so it's possible that Bill's horse would have run to the countryside where it could roam freely.	0.044642857142857144	0.0	0.026785714285714284	0.08928571428571429	0.10714285714285714	0.044642857142857144	0.0625	0.14285714285714285	0.07142857142857142	0.0	0.10714285714285714	0.08035714285714286	0.10714285714285714	0.0	0.026785714285714284	112

1642	The aging rockstar had to stop playing guitar because his hands wouldn't cooperate. This suggests that there is a physical issue with his hands. Option A, singing, is not related to the problem with his hands. Option B, arthritis, is a common condition that affects the joints and can cause pain and stiffness. This could certainly affect the rockstar's ability to play guitar. Option C, listening to music, is not related to the problem with his hands. Option D, making music, is a broad term that could encompass many different activities. Without more information, we can't say for sure whether this is related to the problem with his hands.

The sentence also mentions that this was the first time the fan would enter something to see a snap live. This suggests that the fan is going to see a live game for the first time. Option A, football stadium, seems like the most likely answer since the sentence mentions watching a snap, which is a term used in American football. Option B, hot room, and option D, living room, do not make sense in the context of watching a live game. Option C, hockey game, and option E, basketball court, are both possible, but the sentence specifically mentions a snap, which is not a term used in hockey or basketball. Therefore, the answer is A. football stadium.	0.024844720496894408	0.0	0.0	0.006211180124223602	0.055900621118012424	0.031055900621118012	0.024844720496894408	0.2981366459627329	0.037267080745341616	0.0	0.10559006211180125	0.049689440993788817	0.13664596273291926	0.0	0.024844720496894408	161

1669	First, we need to understand what a follow-up checkup is. A follow-up checkup is a medical appointment that is scheduled after a previous medical visit or treatment. The purpose of a follow-up checkup is to monitor the patient's progress, assess the effectiveness of the treatment, and make any necessary adjustments to the treatment plan.Now, let's look at the options. Uncertainty could be a reason for someone to have a follow-up checkup because they may not be sure if the treatment is working or if their condition has improved. Anxiety and stress could also be reasons for a follow-up checkup because the patient may be worried about their health and want to make sure everything is okay. Pain could also be a reason for a follow-up checkup because the patient may still be experiencing symptoms and want to address them.Therefore, the correct answer is A. uncertainty, as it encompasses all the other options and is the most general reason for someone to have a follow-up checkup.	0.01015228426395939	0.0	0.005076142131979695	0.06091370558375635	0.116751269035533	0.025380710659898477	0.03553299492385787	0.2233502538071066	0.05583756345177665	0.0	0.116751269035533	0.05583756345177665	0.1065989847715736	0.0	0.005076142131979695	197

1679	Well stocked aisles usually refer to shelves or displays that are filled with a variety of products. Therefore, options B, C, and D can be eliminated as they are not typically associated with retail or grocery items. Option E is too vague to determine if it would have well stocked aisles. This leaves us with option A, supermarket, which is the most likely place to find well stocked aisles.

Next, we can eliminate option C as it is not a realistic location for finding butter. Option B is a possibility as restaurants often serve butter in small pats with bread or rolls. Option D is also a possibility as pastries often use small pats of butter in their recipes. Option A and E are both correct as butter can be found in small pats in the refrigerator or fridge, either in pre-packaged portions or individually wrapped by the user.

1684	First, we need to identify what a flute is. A flute is a musical instrument that is played by blowing air across a hole in the instrument. Next, we need to consider where someone can get a flute. Option A: Orchestra - While an orchestra may have flutes as part of their instrumentation, it is unlikely that they would provide a flute for someone who is not a member of the orchestra. Option B: Steal it - This is not a legal or ethical option. Option C: Marching band - Similar to the orchestra, a marching band may have flutes as part of their instrumentation, but it is unlikely that they would provide a flute for someone who is not a member of the band. Option D: Symphony - Similar to the orchestra, a symphony may have flutes as part of their instrumentation, but it is unlikely that they would provide a flute for someone who is not a member of the symphony. Option E: Musical instrument store - This is the most likely option. A musical instrument store would have flutes available for purchase or rental. Therefore, the answer is E. Musical instrument store.	0.0045871559633027525	0.0	0.009174311926605505	0.0963302752293578	0.11009174311926606	0.022935779816513763	0.01834862385321101	0.23853211009174313	0.08256880733944955	0.0	0.05045871559633028	0.05504587155963303	0.12844036697247707	0.0	0.013761467889908258	218
1685	First, it's important to understand that not all people go about killing others. However, for those who do, there can be a variety of reasons. A. Murder: Some people may commit murder for personal gain, such as financial or material benefits. Others may do it out of revenge or to settle a score. B. Get killed: This is not a reason for killing someone, but rather a consequence of violent behavior. C. Sporting event: Killing someone during a sporting event is not a valid reason and is considered a criminal act. D. Hate: Hate can be a powerful motivator for violence. People may kill others because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, or other factors that they dislike or disagree with. E. Feel remorse: This is not a reason for killing someone, but rather a feeling that someone may experience after committing a violent act. In summary, people may go about killing others for a variety of reasons, including personal gain, revenge, hate, or other factors. However, it's important to remember that violence is never a solution and can have serious consequences for both the victim and the perpetrator.	0.009009009009009009	0.0	0.0	0.05405405405405406	0.09009009009009009	0.013513513513513514	0.02702702702702703	0.21621621621621623	0.09009009009009009	0.0	0.09009009009009009	0.06756756756756757	0.13963963963963963	0.0	0.018018018018018018	222
1686	First, we need to understand what an unhealthy meal is. An unhealthy meal is typically high in calories, saturated and trans fats, sugar, and sodium. Now, let's look at the options. A. Gas: Eating an unhealthy meal can cause gas due to the high amount of fiber and carbohydrates that are difficult to digest. However, this is not the most likely outcome. B. Gaining weight: This is the most likely outcome of eating an unhealthy meal. Unhealthy meals are high in calories, which can lead to weight gain over time. C. Electrical circuit: This is not related to eating an unhealthy meal. D. Indigestion: This is a possible outcome of eating an unhealthy meal. Unhealthy meals can cause acid reflux, heartburn, and other digestive issues. E. Getting full: This is a possible outcome of eating an unhealthy meal, but it is not the most likely. Unhealthy meals are often high in calories, so you may feel full initially, but you will likely feel hungry again soon after. Therefore, the most likely outcome of eating an unhealthy meal is gaining weight.	0.0047169811320754715	0.0	0.0047169811320754715	0.0330188679245283	0.08018867924528301	0.0	0.07547169811320754	0.1792452830188679	0.0660377358490566	0.0	0.08962264150943396	0.13679245283018868	0.14622641509433962	0.0	0.02830188679245283	212

Next, what does it mean to be called back to active service? It means that Brian will have to report for duty, which is option A. Option B, wait for orders, doesn't make sense in this context because Brian has already received word that he is being called back to active service. Option C, fight for freedom, is a general statement that could apply to any soldier, but it doesn't specifically answer the question of what Brian will have to do soon. Option D, obey, is a vague answer that doesn't provide any specific information about what Brian will have to do soon.

1698	If people are agreeing with each other, it means they are on the same page and have similar opinions or ideas. This creates a sense of unity and understanding among them. A. Rapport: This refers to a close and harmonious relationship between people. If people are agreeing with each other, it could be a sign of rapport, but it's not a definitive indicator. B. Smiles: Smiling is a common expression of happiness and positivity. If people are agreeing with each other, they may be smiling, but it's not a necessary condition. C. Band together: This phrase means to unite or join forces for a common purpose. If people are agreeing with each other, they may band together, but it's not a direct consequence. D. Harmony: This refers to a state of agreement or peaceful coexistence. If people are agreeing with each other, they are in harmony, so this is the most appropriate answer. E. Tears: Tears are usually associated with sadness or emotional distress. If people are agreeing with each other, it's unlikely that they would be crying, so this answer is not correct.

1699	First, we need to identify what a statute is. A statute is a sculpture or monument that is usually made of stone, metal, or other durable materials. Next, we need to consider where birds might be found on a statue. Birds are often depicted in art and sculpture, and they can be found perched on various parts of a statue, such as the head, shoulders, arms, or hands of a human figure. Based on this information, the best answer would be C. city hall, as statues are often found in public spaces such as city squares, parks, and government buildings. However, birds could also be found on statues in other locations such as parks or the countryside. The answer ultimately depends on the specific statue and its location.	0.053691275167785234	0.0	0.013422818791946308	0.040268456375838924	0.087248322147651	0.006711409395973154	0.053691275167785234	0.2550335570469799	0.10067114093959731	0.0	0.087248322147651	0.0738255033557047	0.14093959731543623	0.0	0.013422818791946308	149

Option A, a hockey game, doesn't make sense as there wouldn't be a reason for hamburger patties to be present at a hockey game. Option B, a fast food restaurant, is a possibility as they often freeze their meat patties for storage. Option C, Burger King, is a specific fast food restaurant and is similar to option B. Option D, made from beef, doesn't provide any information about where the hamburger patties were frozen. Option E, cooked on a grill, also doesn't provide any information about where the hamburger patties were frozen.

Pain - Yes, this is also a common feeling as the tragedy may have caused physical or emotional pain.C. Nostalgia - This is less likely as nostalgia is a feeling of longing for a past time or experience that was positive, whereas a tragedy is typically a negative experience.D.

Option A, ""become adult,"" doesn't make sense as it's not a person or group of people who can provide care. Option B, ""adult,"" is too broad and doesn't specify who the adult is. It could be anyone from a teacher to a stranger on the street. Option C, ""swing set,"" is an object and cannot provide care for a child. Option D, ""parent,"" is a common caregiver for a child. Parents are typically responsible for providing food, shelter, and emotional support for their children. Option E, ""father,"" is a specific type of parent and can also be a common caregiver for a child. However, it's important to note that not all children have a father present in their lives, and other caregivers such as grandparents, aunts, uncles, or foster parents can also provide care for a child.

1704	First, we need to identify the animal in question - a small dog. Next, we need to consider its basic needs - one of which is to relieve itself. Therefore, the answer is E. outside. Small dogs, like all dogs, should be taken outside to a designated area where they can relieve themselves. This could be a backyard, a park, or even just a patch of grass outside the home. It is important to clean up after the dog to maintain cleanliness and hygiene.	0.020618556701030927	0.0	0.020618556701030927	0.07216494845360824	0.08247422680412371	0.010309278350515464	0.07216494845360824	0.16494845360824742	0.08247422680412371	0.010309278350515464	0.10309278350515463	0.041237113402061855	0.15463917525773196	0.0	0.010309278350515464	97

Traffic jams: While driving can certainly lead to traffic jams, this is not a form of personal use. C. Moving: While driving can be used for moving personal belongings, this is not the most common use of driving. D. Status: While some people may use driving as a way to show off their status (such as driving a luxury car), this is not the most common reason for driving. E.

Therefore, options A and D (forest and park) are the most likely places to find many squirrels outside of the city. Option B (yard) may also have squirrels, but it depends on the location and availability of trees. Option C (street) is unlikely, as squirrels tend to avoid busy areas with cars and people. Option E (desert) is also unlikely, as squirrels prefer more temperate climates with access to water and vegetation.

1717	First, we know that James was cooling off, which means he was trying to lower his body temperature. This eliminates options A and D, as sweating and shivering both indicate that the body is trying to raise its temperature. Option C, revenge, is unlikely as there is no context or reason given for James seeking revenge. That leaves us with options B and E. James could have been cooling off in the pool for relaxation purposes, as swimming and being in water can be calming and enjoyable. Alternatively, he could have been trying to lose heat, as being in water can help dissipate heat from the body. Therefore, the most likely answer is E, loss of heat, although B, relaxation, is also a possibility.	0.03496503496503497	0.0	0.013986013986013986	0.04895104895104895	0.1258741258741259	0.02097902097902098	0.03496503496503497	0.1888111888111888	0.0979020979020979	0.0	0.13986013986013987	0.02097902097902098	0.13286713286713286	0.0	0.027972027972027972	143

1719	First, you could check if any friends or family members have a baseball that you could borrow. If that is not an option, you could try asking someone at a park if they have an extra ball or if you could join in their game. If those options do not work, you could go to a sporting goods store to purchase a baseball.

1720	First, we know that the barn was torn to shreds. This suggests that some kind of force or phenomenon caused the destruction. Next, we learn that the pieces of board from the barn became projectiles flying through the air. This suggests that the force or phenomenon was strong enough to launch the boards with significant speed and force. Finally, we are told that the boards were flying through the air one after another, suggesting a continuous and powerful force. Putting all of this together, the most likely answer is A. tornado, as tornadoes are known for their destructive power and ability to launch objects through the air.	0.06722689075630252	0.0	0.025210084033613446	0.03361344537815126	0.05042016806722689	0.04201680672268908	0.05042016806722689	0.226890756302521	0.09243697478991597	0.008403361344537815	0.12605042016806722	0.05042016806722689	0.10084033613445378	0.0	0.008403361344537815	119
1721	"The person was bored by the remedial math class, which means they did not find it interesting or engaging. Therefore, they likely wanted something more than just basic math skills. A.

1722	First, Sally needed a break from her hard work. This means she was likely tired and needed some rest and relaxation. Next, she took a vacation. This means she went somewhere to get away from her usual routine and enjoy some time off. Finally, the question asks what she decided to do to a sand castle. This means she likely went to a beach or somewhere with sand and decided to interact with a sand castle in some way. Out of the given options, the most logical answer is C. construct, as Sally likely decided to build or create a sand castle of her own. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of the question.	0.07518796992481203	0.0	0.0	0.06766917293233082	0.03007518796992481	0.0	0.08270676691729323	0.18045112781954886	0.10526315789473684	0.0	0.14285714285714285	0.05263157894736842	0.09774436090225563	0.0	0.03007518796992481	133

1724	Mary never allowed her animal friend to do what without a leash? A. Leave home - This option is possible, but it doesn't seem like the most likely answer. It's common for pet owners to use leashes when taking their animals outside, but it's not necessarily a requirement for them to stay inside their home. B. Vomit - This option doesn't make sense. Vomiting is a natural bodily function that animals can't control, so it wouldn't make sense for Mary to require her animal friend to be on a leash to prevent it from happening. C. Eating - This option also doesn't make sense. Animals need to eat to survive, and it's not something that can be controlled by a leash. D. Hunt for food - This option is possible. If Mary's animal friend is a predator, she may want to keep it on a leash to prevent it from hunting and potentially harming other animals. E. Fight for life - This option is also possible. If Mary's animal friend is aggressive or has a history of fighting, she may want to keep it on a leash to prevent it from attacking other animals or people. Based on these options, the most likely answer is either D or E. Without more information about Mary and her animal friend, it's impossible to say for sure which one is correct.	0.011583011583011582	0.0	0.0	0.0888030888030888	0.09266409266409266	0.019305019305019305	0.03088803088803089	0.1776061776061776	0.07722007722007722	0.0	0.10424710424710425	0.06177606177606178	0.09652509652509653	0.0	0.03088803088803089	259
1725	First, we need to consider what might make a grumpy cat happy or at least content. Grumpy cats are often known for their dislike of social interaction and their desire for solitude. They may also enjoy cozy and comfortable spaces where they can relax and nap.With that in mind, option A (sand box) and option B (back yard) may not be the best choices for a grumpy cat. Sand boxes can be messy and uncomfortable, while back yards may be too open and exposed for a cat who prefers privacy.Option C (ground) is also not ideal, as it doesn't provide any shelter or comfort for the cat.Option D (warm bed) could be a good choice, as it offers a cozy and comfortable space for the cat to rest and relax. However, it may not be the best option if the grumpy cat doesn't like being touched or handled.Option E (shelf) could be a great choice for a grumpy cat, as it provides a high vantage point where the cat can observe its surroundings without feeling threatened or exposed. It also offers a cozy and enclosed space for the cat to curl up and nap.Overall, the best place for a grumpy cat will depend on the individual cat's preferences and personality. However, a cozy and comfortable space that offers privacy and solitude, such as a warm bed or a shelf, is likely to be a good choice.	0.02527075812274368	0.0	0.0036101083032490976	0.05054151624548736	0.08664259927797834	0.01444043321299639	0.032490974729241874	0.21660649819494585	0.07220216606498195	0.0	0.09025270758122744	0.11913357400722022	0.11913357400722022	0.0	0.0036101083032490976	277
1726	The farmer needed to go to the dental office, so he would have to go to a place where there is a dental office. The options given are Michigan, pub, town, hospital, and street. Michigan is a state and not a specific location, so it is unlikely that the dental office is located there. A pub is a place to drink and socialize, so it is unlikely that the dental office is located there. A street is a general location and not a specific destination, so it is unlikely that the dental office is located there. This leaves us with town and hospital. While a dental office could be located in a town, it is more likely to be located in a hospital. Therefore, the answer is D. hospital.	0.047619047619047616	0.0	0.006802721088435374	0.047619047619047616	0.12244897959183673	0.04081632653061224	0.034013605442176874	0.17687074829931973	0.034013605442176874	0.0	0.08163265306122448	0.08843537414965986	0.12244897959183673	0.0	0.02040816326530612	147

He then brought it through his door, which implies that he was entering a private space. This eliminates option E, as a demonstration would likely be in a public space. Finally, he set it up by the sofa, which suggests that he was in a living room or similar space. This leaves us with option C, apartment, as the most likely answer. Therefore, Simon took his computer to his apartment.	0.0603448275862069	0.0	0.008620689655172414	0.11206896551724138	0.04310344827586207	0.02586206896551724	0.04310344827586207	0.19827586206896552	0.11206896551724138	0.0	0.10344827586206896	0.05172413793103448	0.13793103448275862	0.0	0.017241379310344827	116
1729	First, becoming inebriated means that someone is getting drunk or intoxicated. This can lead to impaired judgment and coordination. A. Fights: When someone is drunk, they may become more aggressive or confrontational, which could lead to fights or altercations with others. B. Addiction: Repeatedly becoming inebriated can lead to a dependence on alcohol or other substances, which can develop into addiction. C. Arrest: If someone becomes too drunk and engages in illegal behavior, such as driving under the influence or disorderly conduct, they could be arrested. D. Staggering: As mentioned earlier, becoming inebriated can impair coordination and balance, which could lead to stumbling or staggering. E.

1732	First, the person is trying to hit the paramedics, which means they are being aggressive and potentially violent. In this situation, the paramedics need to protect themselves and ensure their own safety. Therefore, they will have to use their hands to defend themselves, block the person's attacks, and possibly restrain them if necessary. However, they will not use their hands to hurt or kidnap the person, as that would be illegal and unethical.

1737	James needs a new hammer because his old one is bent. A repair shop might be able to fix the old hammer, but it's not the best option for finding a new one. A carpenter's toolbox might have a hammer, but it's unlikely that James would have access to someone else's toolbox. A tool box is where James might keep his own tools, but it's not a place to buy new ones. A tool shop is a possibility, but it's not as common as a hardware store. Therefore, the best answer is D. hardware store, where James can find a variety of hammers to choose from.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.056451612903225805	0.12903225806451613	0.03225806451612903	0.024193548387096774	0.21774193548387097	0.04032258064516129	0.0	0.056451612903225805	0.0967741935483871	0.0967741935483871	0.0	0.04032258064516129	124
1738	"First, a blackout occurs, which means a temporary loss of consciousness or memory. This can be caused by various factors such as alcohol, drugs, head injury, or medical conditions. If the blackout is caused by alcohol, it may lead to drunkenness, which is a state of being intoxicated or impaired by alcohol. After the blackout, the person may experience amnesia, which is a partial or complete loss of memory. This can be temporary or permanent, depending on the cause and severity of the blackout. There may also be a hangover, which is a collection of symptoms that occur after excessive alcohol consumption, such as headache, nausea, and fatigue. It is unlikely that the person would ""enjoy"" the blackout or its consequences, as it can be a frightening and disorienting experience. Lastly, there is no mention of burning in relation to a blackout from amnesia."	0.023529411764705882	0.0	0.0	0.041176470588235294	0.10588235294117647	0.011764705882352941	0.01764705882352941	0.21764705882352942	0.11176470588235295	0.0	0.07647058823529412	0.07058823529411765	0.15294117647058825	0.0	0.011764705882352941	170
1739	First, the woodworker should check the immediate area where they were working to see if the screw fell on the ground. If it's not there, they should check their tool box to see if it was accidentally placed there. If it's still not found, they should check any nearby surfaces or fixtures where the screw may have gotten stuck, such as a wall outlet fixture. Checking a motorcycle or computer would not be relevant in this situation. Therefore, the most likely answer is C. on the ground, but the woodworker should also check A. tool box and B. wall outlet fixture.	0.06140350877192982	0.0	0.0	0.06140350877192982	0.11403508771929824	0.05263157894736842	0.07017543859649122	0.16666666666666666	0.03508771929824561	0.0	0.11403508771929824	0.043859649122807015	0.09649122807017543	0.0	0.02631578947368421	114

She lived in a cramped apartment in the city, instead of owning a house on the countryside.	0.07777777777777778	0.0	0.0	0.06666666666666667	0.03333333333333333	0.044444444444444446	0.03333333333333333	0.2222222222222222	0.12222222222222222	0.0	0.13333333333333333	0.022222222222222223	0.08888888888888889	0.0	0.022222222222222223	90
1741	The people were confused by the words being spoken. This means that they did not understand what was being said. A. hurt people - This option does not explain why the people were confused. It suggests that the words caused harm to people, which is not mentioned in the question. B. mean many things - This option suggests that the words had multiple meanings, which could have caused confusion. However, it does not explain why the people were confused. C. hurtful - This option suggests that the words were hurtful, but again, it does not explain why the people were confused. D. hurt feelings - This option suggests that the words caused hurt feelings, but it does not explain why the people were confused. E. unclear - This option is the best answer.

1744	The sentence states that there was a tentative peace after the war. This means that there was some level of calm or agreement, but it was not certain or stable. The sentence also mentions that people did not think this peace would last. Why? Because despite a desire to move forward, there were difficulties with rebuilding. This implies that there was some level of destruction or damage caused by the war. Therefore, the answer is D. destruction. Option E, turmoil, could also be a possible answer, but it is not as directly stated in the sentence as the concept of destruction.

1746	First, we know that the snake was worried about predators overhead. This means that it was likely in an open area where it could be seen from above. Next, we need to consider where the snake could go for cover. A wooded area or tropical forest could provide cover, but it's not clear from the question whether the snake was already in such an area or not. A warm place or sleeping bag would not be relevant options for a wild snake. Therefore, the most likely answer is D. canyon. Canyons often have high walls that can provide cover from predators overhead.	0.03508771929824561	0.0	0.017543859649122806	0.05263157894736842	0.11403508771929824	0.043859649122807015	0.07894736842105263	0.18421052631578946	0.07017543859649122	0.0	0.07894736842105263	0.09649122807017543	0.09649122807017543	0.0	0.017543859649122806	114
1747	A. Teaching to the test: This may help students perform well on standardized tests, but it does not necessarily make someone a good teacher. A good teacher focuses on helping students understand and apply concepts, not just memorize information for a test.B. Vacation: While taking breaks and having time off is important for a teacher's well-being, it does not directly contribute to their effectiveness as a teacher.C. Interested students: Having engaged and motivated students can make teaching easier and more enjoyable, but it is not solely the responsibility of the students to be interested. A good teacher creates an environment that fosters curiosity and encourages students to be engaged.D. Students to learn: This is a fundamental aspect of teaching, but it is not enough to make someone a good teacher. A good teacher goes beyond just ensuring that students learn the material and helps them develop critical thinking skills and a love of learning.E. Educate students: This is the primary goal of teaching, but it is not enough to simply impart knowledge. A good teacher also helps students develop skills such as problem-solving, communication, and collaboration.Overall, the answer is D and E. A good teacher is someone who is dedicated to helping their students learn and grow, and who goes beyond just imparting knowledge to help students develop important skills and a love of learning.	0.011538461538461539	0.0	0.0	0.05384615384615385	0.057692307692307696	0.007692307692307693	0.04230769230769231	0.21153846153846154	0.06538461538461539	0.0	0.14615384615384616	0.08461538461538462	0.10384615384615385	0.0	0.0038461538461538464	260

Option A, a pet shop, is the most likely place to find a hermit crab for sale as a pet. Option B, fishmongers, typically sell fish and seafood for consumption, not as pets. Option C, the intertidal zone, is a natural habitat for hermit crabs, but it is not legal or ethical to take them from the wild as pets. Option D, tidepools, are also a natural habitat for hermit crabs and should not be disturbed. Option E, the ocean, is the natural habitat of hermit crabs, but it is not legal or ethical to take them from the wild as pets.

1749	If you respect someone, it means you hold them in high regard and have a positive opinion of them. Therefore, options A, C, D, and E are not appropriate responses.

It can be something small or something more significant, but the gesture itself is what matters.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.16049382716049382	0.09876543209876543	0.012345679012345678	0.024691358024691357	0.14814814814814814	0.037037037037037035	0.0	0.09876543209876543	0.07407407407407407	0.14814814814814814	0.0	0.0	81
1750	After getting wet, the first thing that could happen is feeling cold. This is because water conducts heat away from the body faster than air, causing a drop in body temperature. If you stay wet for a prolonged period, you could catch a cold or flu. This is because being wet weakens your immune system, making you more susceptible to infections. Getting wet could also cause skin rash if you have sensitive skin or if the water contains irritants like chlorine or salt. However, getting wet does not cause melting, as that only happens to substances that can change from solid to liquid form. Therefore, the correct answers are A, C, and E.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0546875	0.0859375	0.0390625	0.0546875	0.1796875	0.0859375	0.0	0.125	0.1171875	0.1171875	0.0	0.0078125	128
1751	When someone gets drunk, their inhibitions are lowered, which means they are more likely to engage in behaviors they might not otherwise do. This includes making decisions they might not make when sober, such as sleeping with someone they wouldn't usually approve of. Additionally, alcohol can impair judgment and decision-making abilities, making it harder for someone to make rational choices about their sexual behavior.

This means that the staffing at the previous facility was not providing adequate care for the mother. The options given are neglect, manual, indifferent, apathetic, and disregard. Neglect implies a lack of care or attention, which could be a possibility. Manual does not make sense in this context. Indifferent means lacking interest or concern, which could also be a possibility. Apathetic means showing no emotion or interest, which is similar to indifferent. Disregard means to ignore or pay no attention to, which could also be a possibility.

1756	First, we need to consider the safety of the meat. If the meat has been sitting out at room temperature for more than two hours, it should not be consumed and should be discarded. Assuming the meat is fresh and has been properly stored, it should be kept in the fridge if it will be used within a few days. If it will not be used within that time frame, it can be stored in the freezer for longer-term storage.

1758	First, we know that James tripped while running in the house. This means that there was something on the floor that caused him to trip. Next, we know that his mother had repeatedly warned him to put his toys away but he did not listen. This suggests that his toys were likely on the floor and not put away properly. Therefore, the most likely answer is B. floor. His toys were probably scattered on the floor, causing him to trip and fall. The other options (slippery, store, drawer, basement) do not fit the context of the sentence and are not related to the cause of James' fall.	0.08064516129032258	0.0	0.016129032258064516	0.10483870967741936	0.06451612903225806	0.04032258064516129	0.07258064516129033	0.14516129032258066	0.056451612903225805	0.0	0.14516129032258066	0.03225806451612903	0.12903225806451613	0.0	0.024193548387096774	124
1759	First, we know that knights were historically associated with medieval times and castles. However, since the US is a relatively young country and was not established during the medieval period, it is unlikely that a knight would be found in the US during that time period (option A). Second, while knights are often depicted in chess sets, they are not actually physically present in the US in that context (option B). Third, historical novels may feature knights, but again, they are not physically present in the US (option C). Fourth, while there are some castles in the US, they are not typically inhabited by knights (option D). Therefore, the most likely answer is option E: a knight may be found in the US guarding the king, but only in a fictional or theatrical context (such as a Renaissance fair or a play).	0.04678362573099415	0.0	0.005847953216374269	0.03508771929824561	0.08771929824561403	0.029239766081871343	0.08771929824561403	0.17543859649122806	0.07602339181286549	0.0	0.05263157894736842	0.07602339181286549	0.1695906432748538	0.0	0.06432748538011696	171

By identifying the constellation a star is located in, we can use technology to pinpoint its exact location in space.	0.019230769230769232	0.0	0.038461538461538464	0.0673076923076923	0.0673076923076923	0.009615384615384616	0.028846153846153848	0.25	0.09615384615384616	0.0	0.125	0.07692307692307693	0.1346153846153846	0.0	0.009615384615384616	104
1780	"First, we know that a bald eagle is a bird that can fly. Second, we know that it needs clear skies to soar. A. A nature preserve could be a possible location for a bald eagle to soar in clear skies, as it is a protected area with natural habitats for wildlife. B. A mountainous area could also be a possible location for a bald eagle to soar in clear skies, as it provides a high vantage point for the bird to hunt and survey its surroundings. C. Washington is a state in the United States that is known for its bald eagle population, so it is also a possible location for a bald eagle to soar in clear skies. D. Soup is not a location where a bald eagle would soar in clear skies, as it is a food item and not a place. E. ""Colorado in Washington"" is not a clear location and does not make sense in the context of the question.

1781	First, we need to understand what the question is asking. The question is asking for the term used when animals produce offspring. Option A, birth, refers to the process of delivering a baby or young animal. While it is a part of the reproductive process, it is not the term used for the entire process. Option B, reproduce asexually, refers to a type of reproduction where an organism can produce offspring without the involvement of another organism. This is not the term used for the process of animals producing offspring as most animals reproduce sexually. Option C, lie down, is not related to the process of animals producing offspring. Option D, procreate, is the correct answer. Procreate means to produce offspring sexually. Option E, feel pain, is not related to the process of animals producing offspring. Therefore, the correct answer is D. procreate.	0.029940119760479042	0.0	0.005988023952095809	0.023952095808383235	0.059880239520958084	0.017964071856287425	0.03592814371257485	0.25149700598802394	0.09580838323353294	0.0	0.1377245508982036	0.03592814371257485	0.1437125748502994	0.0	0.011976047904191617	167

1783	First, it's important to note that depression is a serious mental health issue that should be addressed with professional help. However, in this scenario, the friends threw a party for the person who was depressed. A. Reciprocity: This option suggests that the friends threw the party because they expected something in return. However, there is no indication in the scenario that the depressed person owed their friends anything or that the friends expected anything in return. B. Make happy: This option seems more likely. The friends may have thrown the party to try to cheer up their friend who was feeling down. C. Make money: This option doesn't seem to fit the scenario. There is no indication that the friends were trying to make money from the party. D. Get drunk: This option also doesn't seem to fit the scenario. There is no indication that the friends were focused on getting drunk at the party. E. Embarrassing yourself: This option doesn't seem to fit the scenario either. There is no indication that the depressed person was embarrassed at the party or that the friends were trying to embarrass them. Therefore, the most likely answer is B.

1785	First, a stray small dog is a dog that is lost or has no owner. Therefore, option C (own home) and option E (on a leash) are not applicable. Option D (Georgia) is also not a relevant answer as it does not provide any information on where to find a stray small dog. Option A (animal shelter) is a possible answer as animal shelters often take in stray dogs and try to find them new homes. Option B (big house) is not a clear answer as it does not specify where the big house is located or why a stray small dog would be found there. Therefore, the best answer is A (animal shelter).	0.022222222222222223	0.0	0.0	0.02962962962962963	0.0962962962962963	0.022222222222222223	0.044444444444444446	0.21481481481481482	0.044444444444444446	0.0	0.06666666666666667	0.11851851851851852	0.15555555555555556	0.0	0.022222222222222223	135
1786	First, we know that the place is where thousands of companies and a rosebush call home. This means it must be a location where both businesses and plants can thrive. Option D, Delaware, is unlikely to be the answer as it is a state and not a specific location. Option B, the Rose Parade, is a specific event and not a permanent location. Option E, planting, is too broad and could refer to any location where plants are grown. Option A, lawn, is a possibility as it is a location where both businesses and plants can exist. However, it is not specific enough. This leaves us with option C, backyard, which is a specific location where both businesses and plants can exist.

1787	First, we know that the small dog spent a lot of time with the elderly, which suggests that he was involved in some kind of volunteer work or therapy program. Next, we need to consider the options given in the answer choices. A. Own house - This doesn't make sense as a volunteer location, as it implies that the elderly people came to the dog's house. B. Nursing home - This is a likely option, as many nursing homes have therapy dog programs where dogs visit and spend time with residents. C. Park - While it's possible that the dog and elderly people could have met at a park, it doesn't seem like a consistent or reliable location for volunteer work. D. Own home - This is the same as option A and doesn't make sense as a volunteer location. E. Suburb - This is a location, not a specific volunteer opportunity, so it doesn't fit the question. Therefore, the most likely answer is B. Nursing home.	0.031578947368421054	0.0	0.010526315789473684	0.03684210526315789	0.06842105263157895	0.03684210526315789	0.021052631578947368	0.24736842105263157	0.07894736842105263	0.0	0.08421052631578947	0.06842105263157895	0.11578947368421053	0.0	0.03684210526315789	190
1788	First, we know that Billy bought silk clothing for his wife. This means that the clothing is made of silk material. Next, we can eliminate options C and E as they do not relate to the type of clothing that Billy bought. Option B is a possibility, but it is too general. It could be any type of expensive clothing made of silk. Option D is a good possibility as it is a general term for any type of clothing. Option A is also a good possibility as nightgowns are often made of silk material and are a popular gift for wives. Therefore, the most likely answers are A and D.

1790	First, we know that Bill was a weasel. This means he was likely a cunning and sly individual. Next, the statement says that he was someone you wanted on your side. This suggests that he had some sort of valuable skill or resource. Finally, the statement says that he held something. Out of the options given, the most likely answer is C. candles. Weasels are known for their ability to see in the dark, so it's possible that Bill had some sort of expertise in candle-making or candle-holding that made him a valuable ally.

Once we have this knowledge, we can then look for print resources that provide information on the anatomy of a blowfish. This could include books on marine biology, fish anatomy, or even cookbooks that feature blowfish as a delicacy. Therefore, the correct answer is C. books.	0.0	0.0	0.05128205128205128	0.08974358974358974	0.07692307692307693	0.01282051282051282	0.0641025641025641	0.21794871794871795	0.10256410256410256	0.0	0.10256410256410256	0.038461538461538464	0.1282051282051282	0.0	0.02564102564102564	78
1792	First, we need to understand that water can be found underground in certain areas. So, options A, B, and C are unlikely to have water underneath them. Option D, a bridge, is also unlikely to have water underneath it unless it is built over a river or a body of water. Option E, a house, is a bit more complicated. It depends on the location of the house and the type of soil it is built on. If the house is built on a water table or near a body of water, there may be water underneath it. However, if the house is built on dry land, there may not be any water underneath it. Therefore, the most likely answer is E, a house, but it depends on the specific location and circumstances.	0.03225806451612903	0.0	0.0064516129032258064	0.07096774193548387	0.1032258064516129	0.025806451612903226	0.05161290322580645	0.2	0.1032258064516129	0.0	0.05806451612903226	0.04516129032258064	0.14193548387096774	0.0	0.0064516129032258064	155
1793	The first part of the statement says that talking to others can make you feel better. So, we can assume that talking to mean people can have the opposite effect. Option A, dry mouth, doesn't seem to be related to the statement. Option B, changing behavior, could be a possible outcome, but it doesn't directly answer the question of what mean people can cause. Option C, hurt feelings, seems to be the most appropriate answer as it directly addresses the negative impact of talking to mean people. Option D, communicating with others, is not a negative outcome and doesn't answer the question. Option E, anger, could also be a possible outcome, but it doesn't directly answer the question of what mean people can cause.

Option A, ""unbelievable,"" does not fit with the idea that everyone is ordinary. Option B, ""strange,"" is a possibility, as people may be told they are strange even if they are ordinary. Option C, ""special,"" is a common phrase used to make people feel unique and valued, even if they are not inherently exceptional. This is the correct answer. Option D, ""ugly,"" is not relevant to the question and does not fit with the idea that everyone is ordinary. Option E, ""exceptional,"" is the opposite of ordinary and does not fit with the statement that everyone is ordinary.

1795	"First, we need to understand what ""increase its size"" means. It could mean adding more space or making the existing space appear larger. Assuming we are talking about adding more space, the answer would be C. Rooms. One can add more rooms to a building to increase its size. This could be done by building an extension, adding a new floor, or converting existing space into rooms. A and B (city and town) are not applicable as they refer to the location of the building, not its size. D (fall down) is not a viable option as it would result in the destruction of the building, not an increase in size. E (urban area) is also not applicable as it refers to a larger geographical area, not the building itself."	0.006535947712418301	0.0	0.013071895424836602	0.0784313725490196	0.0718954248366013	0.0	0.013071895424836602	0.1895424836601307	0.0915032679738562	0.0	0.1437908496732026	0.0718954248366013	0.1503267973856209	0.0	0.006535947712418301	153
1796	First, we need to identify what kind of trees are being referred to - apple trees. Next, we need to think about where apple trees are typically grown. Apple trees require a temperate climate with well-drained soil, so they are often found in areas with mild summers and cold winters. Based on this information, we can eliminate options C and D (front yard and Wisconsin) as they are not specific enough and do not necessarily fit the criteria for apple tree growth. Option B (mountains) is also unlikely as apple trees typically do not grow at high altitudes. This leaves us with options A (countryside) and E (Washington state). Both of these options are plausible as apple trees are commonly grown in rural areas and Washington state is known for its apple production. Therefore, the answer is either A or E, depending on the context of the question.	0.040697674418604654	0.0	0.023255813953488372	0.046511627906976744	0.0755813953488372	0.011627906976744186	0.06395348837209303	0.2441860465116279	0.10465116279069768	0.0	0.09883720930232558	0.046511627906976744	0.13953488372093023	0.0	0.03488372093023256	172
1797	First, we need to understand what happens when animals get tired. When animals expend energy through activities such as hunting, running, or playing, they eventually become fatigued and need to rest. This is because their muscles and other bodily systems need time to recover and recharge.So, what do animals do when they get tired? Option A, bite, is unlikely as biting is usually a defensive or aggressive behavior, not a response to fatigue. Option C, procreate, is also unlikely as mating requires energy and effort, which would only make an already tired animal more exhausted.Option D, keep alive, is a bit vague and could apply to many different behaviors. However, it's safe to say that most animals are always trying to stay alive, whether they're tired or not.That leaves us with options B and E: groom and lie down. Grooming is a common behavior among many animals, especially primates, and can serve a variety of purposes such as removing parasites, strengthening social bonds, and reducing stress. However, grooming is not necessarily a response to fatigue.On the other hand, lying down is a common way for animals to rest and conserve energy. By lying down, animals can reduce their metabolic rate and allow their muscles to recover. Therefore, the most likely answer is E, lie down.	0.0	0.0	0.007692307692307693	0.04230769230769231	0.06923076923076923	0.023076923076923078	0.06538461538461539	0.19615384615384615	0.06153846153846154	0.0	0.13846153846153847	0.10384615384615385	0.15	0.0	0.0038461538461538464	260
1798	First, we need to identify where we can buy candy and other foods. The options given are movies, supermarket, mall, jar, and television. Movies: While some movie theaters may sell candy and other snacks, it is not a reliable or common place to buy food. Television: It is not possible to buy food directly from a television. Jar: A jar is a container and not a place to buy food. This leaves us with two options: supermarket and mall. Supermarket: This is a common place to buy groceries, including candy and other foods. Mall: Many malls have food courts and snack stands where you can buy candy and other foods.

1799	First, the claustrophobic person is getting in line. This means they are likely surrounded by people or objects in close proximity. Next, we need to consider what claustrophobia is. Claustrophobia is a fear of enclosed spaces or being in situations where escape may be difficult. Putting these two pieces of information together, we can infer that the claustrophobic person is likely feeling anxious. They may be worried about being in a crowded space with limited room to move or escape. Therefore, the answer is A. anxiety.	0.020618556701030927	0.0	0.020618556701030927	0.05154639175257732	0.13402061855670103	0.020618556701030927	0.061855670103092786	0.18556701030927836	0.09278350515463918	0.010309278350515464	0.1134020618556701	0.08247422680412371	0.1134020618556701	0.0	0.041237113402061855	97
1800	First, we know that the horse had given many rides that day. This suggests that the horse was being used for some sort of recreational or commercial purpose, such as trail rides or carriage rides. Next, we are told that they didn't know where to find him. This implies that the horse is not in his usual location or expected place. However, we are given two clues as to where the horse might be located: next to his favorite toy and next to his dinner and bed. These suggest that the horse is likely in a place where he is comfortable and familiar. Based on these clues, the most likely answer is A. found in stall. The stall is where the horse would typically have his dinner and bed, and it's also a place where he would have access to his favorite toy. Additionally, if the horse had been giving rides all day, it would make sense for him to be returned to his stall at the end of the day. The other options (B. farmhouse, C. doing farm work, D. ridden, E. found on ranch) are less likely because they don't fit with the clues given in the sentence.	0.07488986784140969	0.0	0.013215859030837005	0.07488986784140969	0.10572687224669604	0.05286343612334802	0.039647577092511016	0.19823788546255505	0.08370044052863436	0.004405286343612335	0.09691629955947137	0.06167400881057269	0.10572687224669604	0.0	0.039647577092511016	227
1801	The practical husband would be someone who is focused on practicality and functionality rather than just excitement or aesthetics. Therefore, option C can be eliminated. When house shopping, location is a crucial factor for most people. However, the practical husband would be more concerned about the practicality of the location rather than just its appeal. Therefore, option B could be a possible answer. Expense is also an important factor for most people when house shopping. However, the practical husband would be more concerned about getting the best value for his money rather than just the cheapest option. Therefore, option E could be a possible answer. Arriving and movement do not seem to be relevant factors when it comes to house shopping. Therefore, options A and D can be eliminated. Based on the above analysis, the most likely answer would be either B (location) or E (expense).

1825	First, we know that the bathroom faucet is broken and spraying liquid. This means that the water is not flowing out of the faucet in a controlled manner. Next, we are told that the liquid is spraying high up into the air. This suggests that the water is shooting out of the faucet with some force. Given these two pieces of information, the best answer is A. water fountain. A water fountain is a decorative feature that shoots water up into the air in a controlled and often artistic manner. While the broken faucet is not intentional or artistic, the way the water is spraying out of it is similar to the way a water fountain operates.	0.046875	0.0	0.015625	0.03125	0.078125	0.0390625	0.03125	0.2109375	0.1171875	0.0078125	0.125	0.046875	0.0859375	0.0	0.015625	128
1826	If humans act carelessly, they may make mistakes. These mistakes could lead to negative consequences such as accidents, environmental damage, or harm to others. If these mistakes are not corrected, they could escalate into larger problems, potentially leading to conflict or war. Additionally, careless behavior could lead to a lack of responsibility and accountability, which could further exacerbate problems. While reproduction and sex may be a part of human behavior, they are not directly related to the consequences of acting carelessly.

1827	First, we know that all the other locations had new high prices. This means that the prices at the old single screen location did not increase. Next, we know that this location suddenly saw an uptick in customers. This means that more people started coming to this location. Based on this information, we can eliminate options A, B, D, and E. An art show, airport, hotel, or theatre would not necessarily be affected by the prices at other locations. Therefore, the answer is C. Cinema. The old single screen location is likely a movie theater, and with other theaters raising their prices, more people may have started going to this cheaper option.	0.05343511450381679	0.0	0.022900763358778626	0.030534351145038167	0.06870229007633588	0.030534351145038167	0.03816793893129771	0.21374045801526717	0.061068702290076333	0.0	0.10687022900763359	0.09923664122137404	0.1450381679389313	0.0	0.015267175572519083	131

The reason for this is given in the next part of the sentence, which says ""because he experienced what?"" This means that something happened to Justin that prevented him from dancing for a longer period of time. Option A, meeting people, does not seem relevant to the question as it does not explain why Justin couldn't dance long. Option B, having fun, is also not a likely answer as it does not provide a reason for Justin's inability to dance for a longer period of time. Option C, fatigue, seems like a possible answer as it suggests that Justin became tired or exhausted from dancing and had to stop. Option D, manual, does not make sense in the context of the question. Option E, become tired, is similar to option C and could be a possible answer.

1835	First, we know that the lizard frightened the hiker. This means that the hiker was scared by the lizard. Next, we know that the lizard's movements made a rustle. This means that the lizard was moving in a way that caused a sound. So, what could the lizard be moving through that would make a rustling sound? A. Garden - It's possible that the hiker and lizard were in a garden, but it's unlikely that the lizard's movements would make a rustling sound in a garden. B. Trees - This is a more likely option. If the hiker and lizard were in a forest or wooded area, the lizard's movements through the leaves and branches could make a rustling sound. C. Books - It's unlikely that the hiker and lizard were in a library or bookstore, so this option can be eliminated. D. Rocks - If the hiker and lizard were in a rocky area, the lizard's movements could make a scraping or crunching sound, but not a rustling sound. E. Bushes - This is another likely option. If the hiker and lizard were in an area with bushes or shrubs, the lizard's movements through the leaves and branches could make a rustling sound.

Option C, ""imagine,"" could be a possibility because some people may daydream or imagine scenarios to help them relax and fall asleep. Option D, ""to work,"" is the opposite of what the question is asking. If someone is tired and wants to nap, they wouldn't go to work.

1840	The sentence states that he had been running for a very long time. This implies that he has been exerting himself physically for an extended period. As a result, he may be experiencing physical symptoms that indicate he needs to stop. Option A, shortness of breath, is a common symptom of physical exertion, especially during cardiovascular exercise like running. This could be a sign that he needs to slow down or stop. Option B, sore feet, is also a possibility. Running can put a lot of strain on the feet, and if he has been running for a long time, his feet may be sore and in need of a break. Option C, cramping, could refer to muscle cramps or stomach cramps. Both are possible during exercise, especially if he hasn't properly hydrated or fueled his body. Option D, leg cramps, is similar to option C but specifically refers to cramps in the legs. This could be a sign that he needs to stretch or take a break. Option E, becoming tired, is a general symptom that could indicate he needs to stop. Running for a long time can be exhausting, and if he is feeling fatigued, he may need to rest. Based on these options, any of them could be the correct answer. However, if we had to choose one, we would go with option A, shortness of breath, as it is a common and potentially serious symptom that could indicate he needs to stop running.	0.031578947368421054	0.0	0.007017543859649123	0.07719298245614035	0.11578947368421053	0.028070175438596492	0.031578947368421054	0.18596491228070175	0.08070175438596491	0.0035087719298245615	0.12631578947368421	0.06315789473684211	0.12982456140350876	0.0	0.0	285
1841	A tabby cat might be happy in an alley if it has access to food and shelter, but it may not be the most comfortable or safe environment for them. A lap is a great place for a tabby cat to be happy, as they love to cuddle and be close to their humans. A cellar may not be the best place for a tabby cat to be happy, as it may be dark, damp, and lacking in stimulation. A street is not a safe place for a tabby cat to be happy, as they may be at risk of getting hit by cars or attacked by other animals. Finally, a tabby cat would be most happy in a loving and comfortable home, where they have access to food, water, toys, and a cozy place to sleep. So the correct answer is E. home.	0.012422360248447204	0.0	0.0	0.049689440993788817	0.13043478260869565	0.012422360248447204	0.024844720496894408	0.18012422360248448	0.10559006211180125	0.0	0.043478260869565216	0.14285714285714285	0.10559006211180125	0.0	0.0	161
1842	First, we need to consider the type of snake. Different species of snakes have different habitats and preferences. Second, we need to consider the altitude of the mountain. Snakes are cold-blooded and require a certain temperature range to survive. Third, we need to consider the specific location on the mountain. Snakes may prefer certain types of terrain or vegetation. With these factors in mind, the answer would depend on the specific species of snake and the mountain in question. However, some possible answers could be:- A rattlesnake may be found on a mountain in Oregon or the Blue Ridge Mountains.- A copperhead may be found on a mountain in Louisiana or the Blue Ridge Mountains.- A boa constrictor may be found in a tropical forest on a mountain.- A garter snake may be found in a variety of mountainous locations, including Oregon and the Blue Ridge Mountains. Overall, the answer is not straightforward and would require more information about the specific snake and mountain in question.	0.021739130434782608	0.0	0.016304347826086956	0.016304347826086956	0.08152173913043478	0.0	0.02717391304347826	0.22282608695652173	0.10869565217391304	0.010869565217391304	0.08695652173913043	0.08152173913043478	0.09782608695652174	0.0	0.04891304347826087	184
1843	First, we need to identify where plants are typically found. Plants can be found in various locations such as parks, gardens, and on the ground. They can also be found in offices and on windowsills, but these locations are less likely to be handled by a city employee. Next, we need to consider where a city employee would be responsible for handling plants. City employees are typically responsible for maintaining public spaces such as parks and gardens. Therefore, the most likely answer is A. park or E. garden. So, the answer is either A. park or E. garden.	0.03571428571428571	0.0	0.017857142857142856	0.026785714285714284	0.10714285714285714	0.017857142857142856	0.08035714285714286	0.25	0.08035714285714286	0.0	0.08928571428571429	0.07142857142857142	0.125	0.0	0.008928571428571428	112

1845	"1. The sentence mentions ""queen"" as something she was hoping for.2. The sentence also mentions ""win"", implying that this is some sort of competition or game.3. The options are: play, castle, deck of cards, monarchy, and beehive.4. A beehive is unlikely to be related to winning or a competition.5. A castle could be related to a game or competition, but it doesn't make sense in the context of ""queen"".6. A deck of cards could be related to winning or a competition, but again, it doesn't make sense in the context of ""queen"".7. Monarchy, on the other hand, is directly related to the concept of a queen. It is also a system of government that could potentially involve competition or winning (e.g. a succession battle).8. Play is a broad term that could refer to many things, but it doesn't provide any clues as to why she was hoping for queen.9. Therefore, the answer is D. monarchy.

1850	The crab was being shipped to be eaten, so it was likely heading to a place where people buy and consume seafood. Option A, the Gulf of Mexico, is a location where seafood is caught, but it doesn't make sense for the crab to be shipped back there to be eaten. Option B, the North Sea, is also a location where seafood is caught, but it's unlikely that the crab would be shipped all the way there to be eaten. Option C, a fish market, is a place where seafood is sold, so this is a likely destination for the crab. Option D, a picnic basket, is not a likely destination for a crab being shipped to be eaten. Option E, a grocery store, is another likely destination for the crab, as this is where people buy seafood to cook and eat at home. Therefore, the most likely answer is either C, a fish market, or E, a grocery store.	0.06914893617021277	0.0	0.0	0.015957446808510637	0.1276595744680851	0.031914893617021274	0.03723404255319149	0.2127659574468085	0.0425531914893617	0.0	0.09574468085106383	0.026595744680851064	0.13829787234042554	0.0	0.010638297872340425	188
1851	Firstly, it is important to acknowledge that driving while intoxicated is illegal and dangerous. It puts not only the driver but also other people on the road at risk. If you were intoxicated and driving your car, the best course of action would be to immediately pull over to a safe location and turn off the engine. This would help prevent any potential accidents or harm to yourself or others. Next, it would be important to seek help. This could involve calling a friend or family member to come pick you up, or calling a taxi or rideshare service to take you home. It is important to avoid driving again until you are sober and able to do so safely. In terms of the havoc that may have been caused, it is important to take responsibility for your actions and make amends if necessary. This could involve paying for any damages or injuries that may have occurred, or seeking help for any substance abuse issues that may have contributed to the situation. Overall, the most important thing is to prioritize safety and take steps to prevent any further harm.	0.02912621359223301	0.0	0.0	0.07281553398058252	0.10679611650485436	0.019417475728155338	0.05339805825242718	0.16990291262135923	0.07281553398058252	0.0	0.1407766990291262	0.07766990291262135	0.0825242718446602	0.0	0.0048543689320388345	206
1852	First, we know that Billy wasn't good at communicating with other people. This means that he had difficulty expressing himself or understanding others. Next, we know that he found a mentor. A mentor is someone who can guide and advise you in a particular area, such as communication skills. Finally, we know that Billy put a lot of effort into something. This something must be related to improving his communication skills, since that was his initial problem and he sought out a mentor for help. Based on this reasoning, the most likely answer is C. exchanging ideas. By working with a mentor, Billy likely learned how to better express his own ideas and listen to others' ideas. This involves a two-way exchange of information and requires effort on both sides. A puzzle (A) or confusion (D) don't seem like productive ways to improve communication skills, and response (E) is too vague to be a clear answer.	0.04864864864864865	0.0	0.016216216216216217	0.08108108108108109	0.05945945945945946	0.032432432432432434	0.03783783783783784	0.2	0.08648648648648649	0.005405405405405406	0.12972972972972974	0.05405405405405406	0.13513513513513514	0.0	0.032432432432432434	185
1853	Jumping rope is a physical activity that requires movement and exertion. This means that it can increase heart rate, which is option D. However, sweating can also be an uncomfortable consequence of jumping rope, which is option A. Having fun and smiling are not uncomfortable consequences, but rather positive ones. Anger is not necessarily a consequence of jumping rope, unless someone becomes frustrated with their performance. Therefore, the correct answer is either A or D, depending on the context.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.044444444444444446	0.1	0.022222222222222223	0.05555555555555555	0.26666666666666666	0.044444444444444446	0.0	0.1	0.06666666666666667	0.12222222222222222	0.0	0.03333333333333333	90

1856	If a country has wealth, it means it has resources, money, and assets that can be valuable to other countries. The leadership of another country may become greedy and want to take advantage of this wealth. Option A, making friends, is unlikely to be the answer because greed usually involves self-interest and taking advantage of others, rather than building genuine relationships. Option B, fighting unfairly, is a possibility because greed can lead to aggression and a desire to win at all costs. However, it is not specific enough to the context of another country's wealth. Option C, conquering opponents, is a more specific and likely answer because it involves using force to take control of another country's resources and wealth. Option D, lying, is also a possibility because greed can lead to deception and manipulation in order to gain an advantage. However, it is not as directly related to the context of another country's wealth. Option E, playing poker, is not a serious answer because it is not a realistic or relevant action for a country's leadership to take in response to another country's wealth. Therefore, the most likely answer is C, conquer opponent.	0.004366812227074236	0.0	0.0	0.03056768558951965	0.07423580786026202	0.026200873362445413	0.05240174672489083	0.27074235807860264	0.07423580786026202	0.0	0.08733624454148471	0.056768558951965066	0.12663755458515283	0.0	0.0	229
1857	The shark followed the fish down into the dark water. This means that the shark went underwater. Option A, the desert, is not a possible answer as deserts are dry and do not have water. Option B, Sea World, is a specific location and not a general answer to where the shark went. Option C, the great outdoors, is too broad and does not provide a specific location. Option D, deep ocean, is the most likely answer as it is where sharks typically live and hunt. Option E, maritime museum, is not a possible answer as it is a man-made location and not a natural environment for sharks. Therefore, the correct answer is D, deep ocean.	0.028985507246376812	0.0	0.0	0.014492753623188406	0.08695652173913043	0.021739130434782608	0.028985507246376812	0.2246376811594203	0.050724637681159424	0.0	0.050724637681159424	0.11594202898550725	0.15217391304347827	0.0	0.0	138

Next, we can consider names that are short and easy to pronounce, as these are often easier for dogs to recognize and respond to. Some examples could be ""Max,"" ""Buddy,"" or ""Charlie."" Finally, we can consider names that have a special meaning or significance to the owner. For example, if the dog was adopted from a shelter, a name like ""Lucky"" or ""Hope"" could be fitting.

They also prefer areas with tall trees for nesting.Next, we need to consider potential threats to a bald eagle's safety. Bald eagles are protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, but they still face threats from habitat loss, pollution, and human disturbance.Based on these factors, the safest place for a bald eagle would likely be a nature reserve. These areas are specifically designated to protect wildlife and their habitats, and often have strict regulations in place to minimize human disturbance. In a nature reserve, a bald eagle would have access to suitable habitat and be protected from many of the threats it might face elsewhere.	0.03225806451612903	0.0	0.012903225806451613	0.03870967741935484	0.06451612903225806	0.0	0.05806451612903226	0.23225806451612904	0.1032258064516129	0.0	0.09032258064516129	0.0967741935483871	0.12258064516129032	0.0	0.01935483870967742	155
1865	"The golfer was great at keeping a calm exterior as he finished up his final shots. This means that he did not show any signs of being overly emotional or excited on the outside. However, the question asks about his internal state. The golfer knew he had won, which suggests that he was feeling positive emotions. However, the question asks specifically about his internal state, so we need to consider which word best describes his emotional state based on the context provided. A. ""Wild"" suggests a lack of control or restraint, which does not fit with the golfer's ability to maintain a calm exterior. B. ""Frenzied"" suggests a state of intense excitement or agitation, which again does not fit with the golfer's calm exterior. C. ""Excited"" is a possibility, as it suggests positive emotions without necessarily implying a lack of control. However, it is not the best answer because it is too general and does not capture the specific emotional state that the question is asking about. D. ""Frantic"" suggests a state of panic or desperation, which does not fit with the golfer's successful performance. E. ""Agitated"" is the best answer, as it suggests a state of restlessness or unease that could be present even if the golfer is able to maintain a calm exterior. This word captures the idea that the golfer may have been feeling a mix of positive and negative emotions, such as excitement and nervousness, as he finished up his final shots."	0.038869257950530034	0.0	0.0035335689045936395	0.05653710247349823	0.0706713780918728	0.02120141342756184	0.0353356890459364	0.18374558303886926	0.08480565371024736	0.0	0.10954063604240283	0.0989399293286219	0.12014134275618374	0.0	0.007067137809187279	283
1866	First, we need to understand what a kosher deli is. A kosher deli is a deli that follows Jewish dietary laws, which means that it serves food that is prepared and served in accordance with Jewish dietary restrictions. Based on this information, we can eliminate options D and E, as they are not necessarily related to Jewish culture or cuisine. Option A, a food court, may have a kosher deli, but it is not the most likely place to find one. Option C, a Jewish community, is a strong possibility as it is likely to have a higher concentration of Jewish people who follow kosher dietary laws. However, the most likely option is B, Jewish neighborhoods. These neighborhoods are known for having a strong Jewish presence and are more likely to have kosher delis and other Jewish food establishments.	0.03184713375796178	0.0	0.012738853503184714	0.06369426751592357	0.09554140127388536	0.006369426751592357	0.03821656050955414	0.1910828025477707	0.050955414012738856	0.006369426751592357	0.08917197452229299	0.1592356687898089	0.11464968152866242	0.0	0.05732484076433121	157
1867	First, we need to identify a place with many coasts. Option B, Costa Rica, fits this description as it is a country located in Central America with coastlines on both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea.Next, we need to identify a place where you could find a sloth. Sloths are native to Central and South America, so options A, C, D, and E can be eliminated. Costa Rica, on the other hand, is known for its diverse wildlife, including sloths.Therefore, the answer is B.

1869	The question states that John loves plants because of how they look. This means that he is attracted to their appearance. Therefore, the part of the plant that John likes best is likely related to its visual appeal. A. Flower petals are certainly visually appealing, but they are only one part of the plant. It is unlikely that John's love for plants is solely based on their petals. B. Cut off limbs are not a desirable part of a plant, so it is unlikely that John likes them best. C. Blooms are a possibility, as they are often the most visually striking part of a plant. However, this answer is still too specific. D. Grow in garden is not a specific part of a plant, but rather a location. It is unlikely that John's love for plants is based solely on where they grow. E. Have roots are not a visually appealing part of a plant, so it is unlikely that John likes them best. Therefore, the best answer is C.

1870	Plants need sunlight to grow, so we need to find a place where they can get plenty of sunlight. A. Roof: This might work if you have a rooftop garden or terrace, but it's not a practical option for most people.B. Ground: This is a good option if you have a garden or yard with plenty of open space and sunlight.C. Park: This is not a practical option since you can't really put your plants in a public park.D. Surface of earth: This is the same as option B, so it's a good option if you have a garden or yard.E. Windowsill: This is a great option if you don't have a garden or yard. You can put your plants in pots or containers and place them on a windowsill that gets plenty of sunlight.So the answer is E.

1871	First, we need to consider the behavior of small dogs. Small dogs are social animals and often enjoy being around other dogs. They may form packs or groups to play and socialize. Next, we need to think about where small dogs might have the opportunity to run in packs. A. Trailer park: While there may be other dogs in a trailer park, it is not necessarily a place where small dogs would run in packs. B. Own home: Small dogs may have other dogs in their own home, but they are unlikely to run in packs in their own space. C. Grandmother's house: Similar to the own home option, small dogs may have other dogs at their grandmother's house, but they are unlikely to run in packs in someone else's space. D. Apartment complex: This is a more likely option. Small dogs in an apartment complex may have the opportunity to interact with other dogs in the building or nearby parks, leading to the formation of packs. E. Basket: This is not a realistic option as a basket is not a place where dogs can run or interact with other dogs. Therefore, the most likely answer is D. apartment complex.	0.0	0.0	0.00881057268722467	0.048458149779735685	0.09691629955947137	0.01762114537444934	0.03524229074889868	0.2290748898678414	0.0881057268722467	0.0	0.07048458149779736	0.11013215859030837	0.10572687224669604	0.0	0.02643171806167401	227
1872	First, we need to understand what a music scale is. A music scale is a series of notes arranged in a specific order. Next, we need to think about where one would typically find resources on music. The post office, assay office, butcher shop, and doctor's office are unlikely places to find information on music scales. Therefore, the most logical answer is B. music store. Music stores specialize in selling instruments, sheet music, and other resources related to music. Jeremy is likely to find books on mastering a music scale at a music store.	0.01818181818181818	0.0	0.01818181818181818	0.03636363636363636	0.05454545454545454	0.00909090909090909	0.045454545454545456	0.3181818181818182	0.08181818181818182	0.0	0.11818181818181818	0.045454545454545456	0.13636363636363635	0.0	0.02727272727272727	110
1873	The question is asking about people who do not care about quality food. This means that they are not concerned with the quality of the food they eat. Option A, cheap, could be a possible answer because people who do not care about quality food may choose cheaper options. Option B, convenient, could also be a possible answer because people who do not care about quality food may choose foods that are easy and quick to prepare, even if they are not of high quality. Option C, bad taste, is not a correct answer because it implies that the people in question actively seek out food that tastes bad, which is not necessarily the case. Option D, bad workmanship, is not a correct answer because it is not related to food. Option E, poor workmanship, is also not a correct answer because it is not related to food. Therefore, the correct answers are A and B.

1874	"When fat is broken down, it releases energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). This energy can be used by the body for various functions such as muscle contraction, cellular metabolism, and heat production. So, to answer the question, we don't necessarily want to do anything to the fat itself when it releases energy. Rather, we want to utilize that energy for our body's needs. Options A, D, and E all involve physical activity, which can help burn calories and use up stored energy from fat.

1876	When someone is getting drunk and stumbling, they might be feeling:1. Dizziness or lightheadedness due to the effects of alcohol on the brain and nervous system.2. Loss of coordination and balance, which can cause stumbling and difficulty walking.3. Impaired judgment and decision-making, which can lead to risky behavior and poor choices.4. Increased confidence and sociability, which can make them more likely to engage in conversations or activities they might not otherwise.5. Nausea or vomiting, which can occur as a result of the body's attempt to rid itself of the alcohol.6. Fatigue or sleepiness, which can occur as the body tries to process the alcohol and recover from its effects.7. Reduced inhibitions, which can lead to increased aggression or fights in some cases.Overall, the experience of getting drunk and stumbling can vary depending on the individual and the circumstances, but it is generally characterized by a loss of control and impaired functioning.	0.023121387283236993	0.0	0.0	0.04046242774566474	0.06936416184971098	0.005780346820809248	0.017341040462427744	0.24855491329479767	0.10404624277456648	0.0	0.11560693641618497	0.05202312138728324	0.10982658959537572	0.0	0.005780346820809248	173
1877	The question is asking where a snowflake looks peaceful. The first part of the question mentions that nobody likes a pile of them in the driveway, which implies that the answer is not related to a pile of snow. Option A, snowstorm, is a possibility, but it doesn't necessarily convey a sense of peace. A snowstorm can be chaotic and dangerous. Option B, air, doesn't make sense because a snowflake is already in the air when it falls. Option C, December, is a month and not a physical location or state. Option D, land, could work because a snowflake can look peaceful when it lands on the ground and creates a blanket of snow. Option E, winter, is a season and not a physical location or state.

1884	The padding was covered with mold, which means it was likely on the floor. The sentence also implies that the padding was hidden or not easily visible. So, the person had to pull up something to reveal the moldy padding. Option A, refrigerator, and option C, fridge, are the same thing, and it's unlikely that the padding would be under a refrigerator. Option D, dishwasher, is also unlikely as the padding is typically not installed under a dishwasher. Option E, cellar, is possible, but the sentence doesn't provide any context to suggest that the person was in a cellar. That leaves us with option B, carpet. It's common to have padding under carpet, and if the carpet is not regularly lifted or cleaned, mold could grow on the padding without being easily visible. Therefore, the correct answer is B, carpet.	0.05917159763313609	0.0	0.005917159763313609	0.029585798816568046	0.11242603550295859	0.023668639053254437	0.047337278106508875	0.1952662721893491	0.0650887573964497	0.0	0.08284023668639054	0.0650887573964497	0.15384615384615385	0.0	0.0	169
1885	First, Sarah opened her newspaper. Then, she sat down somewhere. The question is asking where she sat down after opening her newspaper to the second page. Option A, rug, doesn't make sense as it's not a typical place to sit. Option B, front door, also doesn't make sense as it's not a comfortable place to sit and read a newspaper. Option C, jail, is unlikely as it's not a place where someone would have access to a newspaper. Option D, porch, is a possibility as it's a common place to sit and read. Option E, chair, is also a possibility as it's a common piece of furniture to sit and read in. Therefore, the answer is either D or E, porch or chair, but we cannot determine which one for sure without additional information.	0.018072289156626505	0.0	0.006024096385542169	0.06626506024096386	0.09036144578313253	0.012048192771084338	0.03614457831325301	0.20481927710843373	0.08433734939759036	0.0	0.09036144578313253	0.05421686746987952	0.14457831325301204	0.0	0.018072289156626505	166

Next, we need to consider the context of the question, which is ""where might a ficus be at the entrance?"" This suggests that we are looking for a location where a ficus might be placed near the entrance of a building or space. Based on this information, the most likely answer is B. public building, as ficus plants are often used as decorative plants in public spaces such as lobbies, foyers, and entrances. While a ficus could potentially be found in an arboretum or outdoors, it is less likely to be specifically placed at an entrance in those locations. Wet places may not be suitable for ficus plants, and while a ficus could be found in a home, the question specifically asks about an entrance, which is more commonly associated with public buildings."	0.0446927374301676	0.0	0.01675977653631285	0.0335195530726257	0.11173184357541899	0.027932960893854747	0.0670391061452514	0.20670391061452514	0.10614525139664804	0.0	0.08379888268156424	0.055865921787709494	0.11173184357541899	0.0	0.0111731843575419	179

1907	The dog was wild and didn't listen to its owner. This means that the dog was disobedient and didn't follow commands. The question asks what the person had never given it. A. A treat - Giving a treat is a way to reward good behavior, but it doesn't necessarily guarantee obedience. B. Guard house - A guard house is a shelter for a dog, but it doesn't have any direct impact on the dog's behavior. C. Fleas - Fleas are parasites that can infest a dog, but they don't have any direct impact on the dog's behavior. D. Punishment - Punishment is a way to discourage bad behavior, but it can also make a dog more aggressive and fearful. E. Abandoned - Abandoning a dog is a cruel and irresponsible act, but it doesn't explain why the dog was wild and disobedient. Therefore, the correct answer is D. punishment. The person had never given the dog any punishment for its bad behavior, which could have contributed to its disobedience. However, it's important to note that punishment should be used sparingly and in a humane way, as excessive punishment can harm the dog and damage the owner-dog relationship. Positive reinforcement and training are more effective and humane ways to encourage good behavior in dogs.	0.04897959183673469	0.0	0.0	0.04897959183673469	0.11428571428571428	0.00816326530612245	0.036734693877551024	0.20408163265306123	0.036734693877551024	0.0	0.08571428571428572	0.08571428571428572	0.11020408163265306	0.0	0.02040816326530612	245

1910	First, we know that the girl drank a cup of coffee. This means that she must have been somewhere where coffee was available. Option A, coffee shop, seems like a likely possibility. If the girl went to a coffee shop, she would have had access to coffee. Option B, desk, is less likely. While it's possible that the girl had a cup of coffee at her desk, this option doesn't give us any information about where the desk is located. Option C, office, is also a possibility. If the girl works in an office, she may have had access to coffee there. Option D, upstairs, doesn't give us any information about where the girl drank her coffee. It's possible that she was upstairs, but we don't know where upstairs she was. Option E, table, is also a possibility. If the girl was at a table, she may have had a cup of coffee there.

1911	First, we know that James couldn't get into the event because the ticket office was sold out. This implies that the event was a ticketed event. Next, we know that James wasn't that sad about not being able to get in because he didn't like football anyway. This implies that the event was likely a football game. Based on these clues, we can eliminate options A, D, and E, as they do not typically host football games. That leaves us with options B and C, which are both venues that can host football games. However, stadiums are typically larger and more commonly associated with football games, so the most likely answer is B. Therefore, James might have been at a stadium.	0.06382978723404255	0.0	0.028368794326241134	0.04964539007092199	0.11347517730496454	0.04964539007092199	0.07092198581560284	0.1702127659574468	0.06382978723404255	0.0	0.09929078014184398	0.0425531914893617	0.12056737588652482	0.0	0.03546099290780142	141

1917	First, we need to understand the context of the situation. If you are saying farewell to a group of children, it is likely that they are leaving your presence and going somewhere else. Next, we need to consider what gesture children might make in this situation. Option C, experiencing fear, is unlikely unless there is a specific reason for the children to be afraid. Option D, watching television, is also unlikely as it is not related to the situation at hand. Option E, springing into action, is possible if the children are excited about where they are going next, but it is not a common gesture for saying farewell. That leaves us with options A and B. Option A, waving goodbye, is a common gesture for saying farewell and is likely what the children would do. Option B, rubbing their head, is not a common gesture for saying farewell and is therefore not the correct answer.

Therefore, the answer is either B, bus station, or E, train station, depending on whether the stranger is planning to use a bus or a train.	0.03208556149732621	0.0	0.016042780748663103	0.0481283422459893	0.10695187165775401	0.03208556149732621	0.03208556149732621	0.1925133689839572	0.0481283422459893	0.0	0.11764705882352941	0.0748663101604278	0.12834224598930483	0.0	0.0053475935828877	187
1929	First, we need to understand what it means to be social. Being social means interacting with others and engaging in activities that involve communication and collaboration. Next, we need to consider the context of completing assignments. Assignments are typically individual tasks that require focus and concentration. However, there are ways to incorporate social elements into the process. One option is to study together with classmates. This allows for discussion and collaboration, which can enhance learning and understanding. Students can also form study groups or participate in online forums to connect with others and share ideas. Another option is to incorporate social activities into breaks or after completing assignments. This could include playing games, going for a walk, or simply chatting with friends. Overall, the key is to find a balance between individual focus and social interaction. By incorporating social elements into the process, students can enhance their learning experience and build connections with others.	0.0	0.0	0.011494252873563218	0.04597701149425287	0.06321839080459771	0.0	0.04597701149425287	0.25862068965517243	0.09195402298850575	0.005747126436781609	0.15517241379310345	0.05172413793103448	0.11494252873563218	0.0	0.011494252873563218	174

Living organisms are characterized by certain features such as the ability to grow, reproduce, respond to stimuli, and maintain homeostasis. Now, let's look at the options provided. A. Interaction: This option is too vague and doesn't provide any specific information about the plant's living status. B. Death: If the plant was dead, it would not be considered living. C. Respiration: Respiration is a key characteristic of living organisms, as it involves the exchange of gases to produce energy. Plants undergo respiration, so this option is a possibility. D. Expiration: This option is not relevant to determining whether the plant is living or not. E. Chlorophyll: Chlorophyll is a pigment that allows plants to carry out photosynthesis, which is another key characteristic of living organisms.

1971	First, we need to understand what anthropologists study. Anthropology is the study of human societies and cultures and their development. Next, we need to consider the role of art in human societies. Art has been found in archaeological sites dating back tens of thousands of years, indicating that it has been a part of human culture for a very long time. Given this information, we can conclude that James, as an anthropologist, likely believes that creating art was one of the earliest forms of communication. Art can convey ideas, emotions, and stories without the need for language, making it a powerful tool for communication in early human societies.

Next, we can eliminate options E and D, as a gymnasium or conference room would not typically be a formal or appropriate setting for a ruler to hold court. Option C, a city, is also unlikely as it is too broad and vague. This leaves us with options A and B, a public building or palace. Both of these options could be appropriate for a ruler to hold court, but a palace is more likely as it is a grander and more formal setting for a monarch or ruler. Therefore, the answer is B.

He had an expectation that his money would grow, which means he thought that he would have more money in the future than he has now. However, something happened that did not meet his expectation. So, we need to find an answer that describes what happened to his savings.A. Shrink - This answer fits the context because if Sam's savings shrank, it means that he had less money than he had before. This is the opposite of what he expected, which was for his money to grow.B. Explode - This answer does not fit the context because if Sam's savings exploded, it means that his money increased rapidly and significantly. This is the opposite of what happened to his savings.C. Diminish - This answer fits the context because if Sam's savings diminished, it means that his money decreased. This is the opposite of what he expected, which was for his money to grow.D. Get smaller - This answer fits the context because if Sam's savings got smaller, it means that he had less money than he had before. This is the opposite of what he expected, which was for his money to grow.E. Stagnant - This answer does not fit the context because if Sam's savings were stagnant, it means that his money did not change at all. This is not the opposite of what he expected, which was for his money to grow.Therefore, the correct answer is A.

Option D, ""good karma,"" is also a possible answer because forgiving others is seen as a positive action that can bring good things back to the person who forgives. Option E, ""bad man,"" is not a likely answer because forgiving someone is not a negative trait. Therefore, the most likely answer is A, ""good heart,"" followed by D, ""good karma,"" and possibly C, ""new freedom."""	0.023923444976076555	0.0	0.0	0.05741626794258373	0.09090909090909091	0.028708133971291867	0.03827751196172249	0.17703349282296652	0.06220095693779904	0.0	0.09569377990430622	0.10047846889952153	0.20095693779904306	0.0	0.0	209

1996	"The sentence mentions a ""baby bottle"" and ""packed,"" which suggests that the person is looking for something related to a baby that they brought with them. Option A, ""medicine cabinet,"" doesn't make sense because baby bottles are not typically stored in a medicine cabinet. Option B, ""grocery store,"" also doesn't make sense because the person is already searching for something they packed, not something they need to buy. Option C, ""diaper bag,"" is the most likely answer because it is a common place to store baby items when traveling. Option D, ""dishwasher,"" doesn't make sense because the person is looking for something they packed, not something that would have been used and then washed. Option E, ""liquor store,"" is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the answer is C, ""diaper bag."""	0.05142857142857143	0.0	0.0	0.07428571428571429	0.08	0.03428571428571429	0.04	0.22285714285714286	0.045714285714285714	0.0	0.11428571428571428	0.017142857142857144	0.21714285714285714	0.0	0.0	175

1998	First, we need to understand what a disease is. A disease is a harmful condition that affects the body or mind. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or other pathogens. So, what does a person use to fight off these harmful pathogens? The answer is A. immune system. The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend the body against harmful invaders. It produces antibodies that can recognize and destroy pathogens, and it also has specialized cells that can engulf and digest them. While names, one head, grip, and fingernails may have their own uses, they are not effective in fighting off disease. The immune system is the body's primary defense against disease.	0.006896551724137931	0.0	0.006896551724137931	0.0896551724137931	0.09655172413793103	0.006896551724137931	0.027586206896551724	0.22758620689655173	0.04827586206896552	0.006896551724137931	0.10344827586206896	0.08275862068965517	0.14482758620689656	0.0	0.013793103448275862	145
