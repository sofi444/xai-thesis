First, we know that a hamburger is a type of sandwich made with a cooked patty of ground meat (usually beef). So, we need to look for a place where they serve ground meat.

Option A is a fast food restaurant, and it's likely that they would have hamburgers on the menu.

Option B is pizza, and while some pizza places might offer burgers, it's not as common. So, we can eliminate option B.

Option C is ground up dead cows, which is not a place where you would typically find a hamburger (unless you're looking for a very specific type of dish).
Option D is the mouth, and while you might find food in someone's mouth, it's not likely to be a hamburger.
So, the best answer is:
A) Fast food restaurant
