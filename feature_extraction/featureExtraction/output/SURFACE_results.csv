However, they can also serve as a security measure because they limit the number of people who can enter or exit at one time and can prevent unauthorized access. 

Out of the given options, a revolving door would most likely be used as a security measure at a bank, where it is important to control access to the building and protect the safety of employees and customers.

B) Learning from each other is another aim that people have at work. This means interacting with colleagues and gaining new skills and knowledge that can help in personal and professional growth.

C) Killing animals is not an aim that people have at work unless they work in specific industries like hunting or meat processing.

D) Wearing hats is not an aim that people have at work unless it is a part of their uniform or dress code.

E) Talking to each other is a common activity that happens at work, but it may not necessarily be an aim for everyone. Some people prefer to work independently and limit their interactions with others.

2	"First, we need to identify what type of printed works are being referred to. The question mentions magazines specifically, but also mentions ""many other printed works."" This suggests that we are looking for a place where a variety of types of printed materials are available.

Option A, a doctor's office, may have some magazines but is unlikely to have a wide variety of printed works.

Option C, a market, may have some magazines available for purchase but is also unlikely to have a wide variety of printed works.

Option E, a mortuary, is an unlikely place to find magazines or any type of printed works.

This leaves us with options B and D: a bookstore and a train station. Both of these options are likely to have a variety of printed works available, including magazines. However, a bookstore is specifically designed to sell printed materials, whereas a train station may have a newsstand or convenience store that sells magazines and other printed works as one of many products.

Option A, the midwest, is a popular region for farming in the United States, with states like Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana known for their fertile soil and agricultural production. So, A could be a good option for James to consider. 

Option B, the countryside, is a more general term and could refer to any rural area outside of urban centers. While there may be farmland in the countryside, it is not a specific location for finding farmland. 

Option C, an estate, typically refers to a large property or mansion, which may or may not include farmland. So, this option is not necessarily relevant to James's search. 

Option D, farming areas, is a more general term similar to the countryside, and may or may not lead James to specific farmland for sale. 

Option E, Illinois, is a specific state in the midwest region mentioned in option A. So, E is a viable option for James to consider if he wants to focus on a particular state.

Option A) ""Have time"" doesn't really make sense in this context, so it can be eliminated. 

Option B) ""Boring"" is a possibility - if a book is dry and long, it may be difficult to stay engaged and interesting, and you may become bored. 

Option C) ""Learn new"" is not necessarily the opposite of being bored. While you may learn new things from a dry and long book, it doesn't necessarily mean you won't be bored while reading it. 

Option D) ""Enjoyable"" is unlikely, given that the book is described as both dry and long. 

Option E) ""Bored"" is the most likely answer, as it accurately describes the feeling of disinterest and lack of engagement that may come from reading a dry and long book.

95	First, computers were able to turn on from the power source. This was not a big deal as it was a basic function. Then, they were able to do arithmetic, which was a major breakthrough in the field of computing. However, this still did not address workflow management. Next, computers were able to share files, which was a significant advancement in terms of collaboration and workflow management. However, it was not the first time they were able to manage workflow. Finally, computers were able to multitask, which allowed for the simultaneous execution of multiple programs and processes. This was a big deal when they could first do it and is an underrated aspect of their ability to manage workflow.

128	"First, buying presents for others creates a sense of satisfaction, as we are able to do something nice for someone else. This would align with option C) like. 

Additionally, when the recipient of the gift expresses gratitude and happiness, it can create a feeling of being appreciated and valued, which would align with options D) thank and E) make happy. 

While some gifts may be sentimental enough to bring tears to the recipient's eyes, it's unlikely that this is a common feeling associated with buying presents for others, so option A) tears is not the most accurate answer. Option B) please is also not the most accurate, as it is not a feeling created within the gift giver, but rather the recipient.

191	"First, we need to understand why someone would wear dark glasses indoors. Usually, people wear sunglasses or dark glasses to protect their eyes from bright sunlight. However, wearing them indoors may indicate a different reason.

A) A blind person might wear dark glasses indoors, but this is not always the case. Blind people may wear dark glasses to protect their eyes from bright lights or to reduce glare, but some may not wear them at all.

B) A glove box is a compartment in a car where gloves or other small items are stored. It does not make sense for a glove box to wear dark glasses indoors.

C) A movie studio may have a reason to wear dark glasses indoors, especially if they work with bright lights or camera flashes. However, this answer is too broad and does not specify who in the movie studio would wear them.

Instead, the key ingredient for a successful writer is their imagination (option D).

A) bad mood - This does not make sense in the context of the sentence. A ferret's suitability as a pet is not related to someone's mood.

B) hutch - A hutch is a type of cage for small animals, but the sentence does not mention anything about where a ferret should be kept. Also, the sentence implies that a ferret is not a good pet in general, not just in a hutch.

C) classroom - This is the correct answer. The sentence implies that a ferret would not be a good pet to have in a classroom, where there are likely to be many students and distractions. It is possible that a ferret could cause disruption or be difficult to handle in that environment.

D) pair of trousers - This does not make sense in the context of the sentence. A ferret is an animal, not an article of clothing.

253	When someone is physically competing, their body usually goes through a number of changes in order to perform well. These changes may include increased heart rate, increased respiration, increased blood flow to the muscles, and the release of adrenaline and other hormones to increase energy and focus. The body may also produce sweat in order to cool itself down, and muscles may tense up in order to provide more power and speed. Ultimately, the goal is to perform better and hopefully win the competition. So, the answer choices that fit these descriptions would be A) tension, B) perform better, C) releases heat, and E) sweat. D) winning or losing is not a physical response of the body, but rather a result of the competition.	58.95833333333335	13.427956989247313	4.733870967741935	1.5	0.6693548387096774	0.2328767123287671	0.1095890410958904
254	"First, it's important to understand that not all deaf individuals communicate in the same way. Some may use sign language, while others may prefer lip-reading or written communication. Therefore, it's important to ask the individual how they prefer to receive information.

Assuming the individual communicates through sign language, options A, C, and E are possible solutions. Summarizing main points can help ensure that the information is clear and concise. Writing down information can also be helpful, but it may not be the most efficient way to communicate complex or lengthy information. Finally, talking is not an effective option as the individual may not be able to hear what is being said.

Option B, ""close mouth,"" is not a solution as it does not facilitate communication in any way. Option D, ""may disagree,"" is also not relevant to the question as it does not address how to express information to a deaf person.

349	"First, we need to consider what type of lizard we want as a pet. Different types of lizards have different requirements for their care and living conditions. Once we've decided on the type of lizard we want, we can then look for places to obtain it. 

Option A) Desert country: This could be a possible location to obtain a lizard, depending on the type of lizard we want. For example, if we want a bearded dragon, which is native to Australia, we could try to find a breeder or pet store in Australia or another desert country where they are commonly found.

Option B) Dessert: This is not a viable option for obtaining a lizard as it is a type of food, not a place to find a pet.

Option C) Pet shop: This is a common place to find lizards as pets. Many pet stores carry a variety of reptiles, including lizards. However, we should make sure to research the specific needs of the type of lizard we want before purchasing it from a pet store.

Option D) Tropical areas: This could also be a possible location to obtain a lizard, depending on the type of lizard we want. For example, if we want a gecko, which is commonly found in tropical areas, we could try to find a breeder or pet store in a tropical location.

Option E) Zoo: Zoos do not typically sell animals as pets, so this is not a viable option for obtaining a lizard. However, we could visit a zoo to observe different types of lizards and get an idea of what type of lizard we might want to keep as a pet.

Option B, the Milky Way, is not a constellation either. It is the galaxy in which the Earth and our solar system are located.

Option C, God's creation, is a vague and subjective answer. While some people may consider all of the stars and constellations as God's creation, it does not specify a particular constellation.

Option D, stars, is also not a specific constellation. Stars are individual celestial bodies that can be part of a constellation, but the question is asking for the name of a specific group of stars.

Option E, the universe, is too broad of an answer. The universe includes everything that exists, so it is not a specific group of stars or constellation.

Therefore, the correct answer is none of the above. The most famous constellation out of Earth is the Orion constellation, which is visible in the night sky from most parts of the world.

Option D, the kitchen, is also a common location for people to drink coffee. Many people have coffee makers in their kitchens and enjoy brewing their own coffee at home.

Option B) Faithful: This means the car is reliable and trustworthy. Again, while this is a desirable quality, it does not address the issue of the loose steering. 

Option C) Bound: This means the car is tied or connected to something. This does not make sense in the context of the sentence.

Option D, feline, doesn't provide any information about what the cat wants or needs.

409	"Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that pet birds have specific needs and requirements that must be met in order for them to live happy and healthy lives. Birds are social creatures that need plenty of mental and physical stimulation, as well as access to fresh food and water.

Secondly, letting pet birds free is indeed dangerous for a number of reasons. Depending on the species of bird, they may not be able to survive in the wild due to lack of appropriate food sources, predators, or exposure to harsh weather conditions. Additionally, free-roaming birds can pose a risk to themselves and others, such as flying into windows or causing damage to property.

Given these factors, the best option for pet birds is to keep them caged in a safe and comfortable environment that mimics their natural habitat as closely as possible. This can include providing perches, toys, and hiding spots, as well as regular interaction and attention from their owners.

Therefore, the correct answer is C) caged in."	55.38036764705885	13.911764705882355	4.776470588235294	1.535294117647059	0.6882352941176471	0.2193877551020408	0.11734693877551021

412	If a celebrity goes public about a common problem, it can lead to press coverage, as the media may be interested in covering the story. This can in turn lead to wider acceptance, as the public may empathize with the celebrity and feel that they are not alone in experiencing the problem.

Burial involves placing the body in a grave, while cremation involves burning the body and then disposing of the ashes. Both of these processes are meant to honor the deceased and allow their loved ones to say goodbye.

After the burial or cremation, some cultures may celebrate the life of the deceased with a gathering or memorial service. This is a time for friends and family to come together to remember the person who has passed away and share stories and memories.

As time passes, the body will begin to decompose, returning to the earth from which it came. However, the memories and impact of the person's life may continue to live on through their loved ones and the legacy they leave behind.

455	When a person dies, their body undergoes a process called decomposition. This is when the body's cells and tissues break down and decay. The process is aided by bacteria and other microorganisms that live in and on the body. As the body decomposes, it releases gases and fluids, which can cause the body to swell and emit a foul odor. Over time, the body will break down into its constituent parts, returning to the earth. There is no evidence to suggest that a person's body undergoes rebirth or has any further experiences after death.

Option E) Cut: This is unlikely to be the correct answer, as ""cut"" is usually used to signal the end of a scene or performance, not the beginning.

471	"First, we need to understand what it means to ""learn about the world."" This phrase suggests gaining knowledge and understanding about different cultures, societies, and global issues.

Next, we need to consider why ""poor college students"" are mentioned specifically. It's likely that this is because wealthier students may have more opportunities to travel and learn about the world through firsthand experiences, whereas poorer students may have to rely on other methods of learning, such as reading books, watching documentaries, or attending lectures.

Based on this, we can eliminate options A and C, as ""pleasure"" and ""desire to travel"" are not necessarily the main goals of learning about the world for poor college students who may not have the means to travel extensively. 

Option D, ""global warming,"" seems like a random and unrelated choice, so we can eliminate that as well.

That leaves us with option B, ""greater mobility,"" and option E, ""increased security."" Both of these choices make sense in the context of learning about the world. By gaining knowledge and understanding about different cultures and societies, poor college students may be better equipped to navigate different environments and situations, whether that be for work, travel, or personal relationships. This increased mobility could lead to greater opportunities and success in the future. Additionally, by learning about global issues and challenges, students may become more aware of potential risks and threats, and may be better prepared to face them, leading to increased security.

Therefore, the correct answer is either B) greater mobility or E) increased security, as both of these options are valid interpretations of the benefits that poor college students may gain from learning about the world."	46.987020383693064	15.741486810551562	5.23021582733813	1.6115107913669064	0.5287769784172662	0.26706231454005935	0.13353115727002968

Next, we need to consider the item being stored - a potato. Potatoes are root vegetables that do not require refrigeration and can be stored at cool temperatures for an extended period. 

Using this information, we can eliminate options A, B, and E as they all involve storing the potato in a location that is either not cool or too cold. 

Option D, a bushel basket, is a possible storage option for a potato, but it doesn't necessarily imply a cool and dark storage space like a cellar.

600	"A) Problems - having problems does not necessarily lead to committing murder. People face problems and challenges in life, but most do not resort to murder as a solution.

B) Distress - similarly, feeling distressed or overwhelmed does not necessarily lead to murder. There are many coping mechanisms and resources available to people in distress, and most do not resort to violence.

C) Fear - fear can certainly be a factor in some murders, such as self-defense or fear of retaliation. However, fear alone does not necessarily cause someone to commit murder.

D) Go to jail - this is not a cause of murder, but rather a consequence. People may commit murder for various reasons, but the possibility of going to jail is not typically the driving force behind their actions.

E) Killer - this is the closest answer, but still not entirely accurate. People who commit murder are often referred to as ""killers,"" but this label does not necessarily explain why they committed the act. Some may have a history of violence or aggression, while others may have experienced a triggering event or mental health issue.

Option C) augment - Augment means to make something bigger or better, usually by adding something to it. This option fits logically with the context, as the sentence mentions that the surgeon's clients had begun to reduce, so girls no longer want to augment.

Option D) gain weight - This option does not fit logically with the context. The sentence is about the surgeon's clients reducing, which means they are not coming to the surgeon anymore. It is not mentioned anywhere in the sentence that girls no longer want to gain weight.

665	When we run, our body needs more oxygen to supply our muscles with energy. To get more oxygen, we breathe faster and deeper, leading to breathlessness (option A). As we breathe faster, our heart rate also increases (option B) to pump more oxygen-rich blood to our muscles. Falling down (option C) is not a physiological consequence of running but rather a risk of tripping or losing balance. Muscle bulk (option D) can be a result of strength training but not necessarily from running alone. Calluses (option E) can develop on the feet from friction with running shoes, but they are not a physiological consequence of running either. Therefore, the correct answer is A) breathlessness.	65.09913043478264	11.093167701863354	4.756521739130434	1.4782608695652173	0.6434782608695652	0.19285714285714287	0.09285714285714286

Option C) University campus: Universities often have auditoriums for lectures, presentations, and speeches. This option is plausible. 

Option D) Theater: A theater is similar to an auditorium and is used for performances, but it is usually smaller and has a more intimate setting. This option is not the best fit for the given scenario.

675	"The question states that ""Because of his anger he couldn't clearly explain..."" This means that the person was feeling too angry to express themselves clearly. 

Now, let's look at the choices: 

A) Cool off - This choice makes sense because if the person takes some time to calm down and relax, they may be able to express themselves more clearly. 

B) Write letter - While this may be a good option for some people, it doesn't necessarily address the issue of the person's anger and inability to express themselves verbally in the moment. 

C) Get mad - This choice is the opposite of what the person should do. If they continue to get more angry, they will only make the situation worse and still not be able to clearly explain themselves. 

D) Illustrate point - This choice may be helpful if the person is able to use visuals or examples to explain themselves, but it still doesn't address the root issue of their anger. 

E) Destroy enemy - This choice is not helpful or productive in any way and should not be considered.

Option A - Jerusalem: This is a city in Israel, which has a predominantly Jewish population and is considered the holiest city in Judaism. Therefore, it is likely that there would be many kosher restaurants in Jerusalem. 

Option B - Jewish neighborhoods: These are areas where there is a concentration of Jewish residents. It is likely that there would be kosher restaurants in such neighborhoods. 

Option C - Dining in: This option is not a place, but rather a way of consuming food. It is possible to dine in at a kosher restaurant, but this option does not provide information about where such restaurants are likely to be found.

Option C, loss of control, is not a recommended method for going into trance as it can lead to negative experiences and even harm.

Option D, sleep, is not a recommended method for going into trance as it is a different state of consciousness and does not involve the necessary level of focus and concentration.

B) Nightclub: Horses would not typically be found in a nightclub setting, and it's unlikely that they would be trained to dance in circles.

C) Theatre: This could be a possibility, especially if the show had a musical or dance component that involved horses. However, it's still unclear why the horses would be dancing in circles specifically.

D) Opera: Like the theatre option, this could be plausible if the opera production featured horses in some way. However, the question doesn't provide enough context to determine if this is the correct answer.

E) Ringmaster: This option seems like the most likely choice. A ringmaster is typically associated with a circus or other performance that involves animals. The horses may be part of an act that involves them moving in a choreographed manner, which could explain the circular dancing.
