First, we need to identify what type of printed works are being referred to. The question mentions magazines specifically, but also mentions "many other printed works." This suggests that we are looking for a place where a variety of types of printed materials are available.

Option A, a doctor's office, may have some magazines but is unlikely to have a wide variety of printed works.

Option C, a market, may have some magazines available for purchase but is also unlikely to have a wide variety of printed works.

Option E, a mortuary, is an unlikely place to find magazines or any type of printed works.

This leaves us with options B and D: a bookstore and a train station. Both of these options are likely to have a variety of printed works available, including magazines. However, a bookstore is specifically designed to sell printed materials, whereas a train station may have a newsstand or convenience store that sells magazines and other printed works as one of many products.

Therefore, the best answer is B) bookstore.
