The fox walked from the city into the forest, which suggests that it was looking for a change of environment or habitat. Therefore, the most likely answer is C. natural habitat. The other options, such as pretty flowers or a storybook, are unlikely to be the fox's motivation for leaving the city and entering the forest. The option of a hen house is possible, but it is not the most likely answer as the fox could have found food in the city as well. The option of a dense forest is also possible, but it does not provide a clear reason for the fox's movement from the city.
