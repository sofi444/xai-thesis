Birds are social creatures that need plenty of mental and physical stimulation, as well as access to fresh food and water.\n\nSecondly, letting pet birds free is indeed dangerous for a number of reasons. Depending on the species of bird, they may not be able to survive in the wild due to lack of appropriate food sources, predators, or exposure to harsh weather conditions. Additionally, free-roaming birds can pose a risk to themselves and others, such as flying into windows or causing damage to property.\n\nGiven these factors, the best option for pet birds is to keep them caged in a safe and comfortable environment that mimics their natural habitat as closely as possible. This can include providing perches, toys, and hiding spots, as well as regular interaction and attention from their owners.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C) caged in.", "format": {"answer_letter": "C", "answer_text": "caged in"}}
